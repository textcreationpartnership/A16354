         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For he was woont to ſay, after that he had perfectly put on Chriſt, that even whileſt he was in ſecular ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, he felt a great motion in his heart, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13275:7"/>he heard any worde expreſſing the loue of God. Furthermore the mildneſſe of his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, together with the ſweetneſſe of his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; his patience, and tractable behaviour, more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is ordinary in me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; his liberality, beyond the meaſure of his ability; which appeared in him in his youth, were tokens; that God had a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboundance of bleſſing to powre vpon him.</p>
               <p>It fortuned once that a very ſimple man of <hi>Aſsiſium</hi> (by the inſtruction of God, as we haue good cauſe to thinke) meeting vpon a time with Saint FRANCIS, as he paſſed along the Citty; caſt off his cloake, and ſpread the ſame vnder his feete; affirming that he ſhould be worthie of all manner of reverence: the time beeing nowe not long vnto, wherin he ſhould performe great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: and ſhould be of the whole worlde for that cauſe marveilouſly honored. But yet altogether ignorant was S. FRANCIS at this time of Gods determination concerning him: aſwell beeing by the commaundement of his father, diſtracted in externall affaires: as alſo, by naturall corruption, carried away with terreſtriall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

And becauſe the ſcourge of affliction doth oftentimes giue light to the ſpirituall vnderſtanding, the mighty hande of our Lord did come vpon him; &amp; the right hand of the higheſt wrought a perfect change within him; afflicting his body with lingring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, whereby the better to prepare his ſoule
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:13275:8"/>to receiue the precious inſpirations and motions of the Holy Ghoſt. But having recovered his ſtrength, and being provided of decent apparell according to his vſuall manner; he chanced to meete a certaine ſouldiar, who was in yery deede a gentleman by birth, but poore and meanely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled; whoſe poverty he commiſerating with a ſyncete affection, diſpoiled himſelfe of his own apparell; and furniſhed the poore ſouldiar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall: that ſo, in one worke, he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme a double office, of piety; both in covering the ſhame, of a gentleman ſouldiar; &amp; in releiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miſery of a poore diſtreſſed man.</p>
               <p>In the night following, when he had betaken himſelfe to his naturall reſt; it pleaſed the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, to ſhew vnto him a great and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull pallace, adotned with Military weapons, inſigned with the Croſſe of CHRIST: then fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewing vnto him, that the mercy which he had extended towards the poore ſouldiar, for the loue of the heavenly King; ſhould be recompenced with an incomparable reward. Wherevpon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding vnto whom all thoſe goodly things did appertaine; it was aunſwered to him from aboue, that they ſhould be vpon him and his ſouldiars; freely beſtowed. A waking therefore in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and having his minde not as yet exerciſed in the ſearching of Divine myſteries; neither yet knowing how by the formes of viſible thinges to conſider the trueth of things, inviſible; he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded himſelfe, that this vnaccuſtomed viſion; was a fore token of ſome great proſperity, to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13275:8"/>vnto him. So being as yet ignorant of Gods Divine ordinance towardes him, he purpoſed to goe into <hi>Apulia,</hi> vnto a certaine Earle of great li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality; hoping by ſervice vnder him in the wars to purchaſe a name of honour: according as the mentioned viſion; vnto him ſeemed, to foretell. And being ſhortly after, entred into his iourney; as he came to the next City, he heard in the night time, our Lord in familiar manner, thus ſpeaking vnto him. FRANCIS, who is able to doe better for thee, the maſter or the ſervant, the rich man or the poore?. To whom Saint FRANCIS making aunſwere, that the maſter; and the rich man were better able: Our Lord preſently replied; why therefore doeſt thou leaue the maſter, for the ſervant; and the rich God, for a poore man. Then Saint FRANCIS aſked, what wilt thou haue me, O Lord to doe? And our Lord ſaid vnto him; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into thine owne country: for the viſion which thon haſt ſeene, doth prefigurate a ſpiritual effect, which is to be, by the diſpoſition of God, &amp; not of man; accompliſhed in thee. In the morning therefore, he ſpeedily returned backe to <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> reſting nowe full of ſecurity and ioy: &amp; making himſelfe a patterne of obedience, did rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily expect the pleaſure of our Lord. From that time foreward hee with-drewe himſelfe from the practiſe of his common trafique, and devoutly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought Almighty God, of his mercy; that hee would voutſafe to ſhew vnto him, what he ought to doe. And when by much vſe of praier, the flame of Heavenly deſire; began aboundantly to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13275:9"/>encreaſe in him; ſo that nowe for the loue of the Heavenly country, hee contemned all earthely things, as very nothing, then did he well perceiue himſelfe to haue found, the hidden treaſure; &amp; like a well adviſed marchant, purpoſed with the ſale of all his marchandiſe; to purchaſe this rare and pretious pearle. But as yet he was ignorant how to proceed therein: ſaving that it was to his ſpirit ſugeſted; that the entring into ſpirituall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, is the contempt of the world; and that the warfare of Chriſt, is not otherwiſe to be by any man begun, than by obtaining firſt, the conqueſt of himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Riding therefore one day vpon the plaine,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in mind, an eſpeciall horror, and loathing. But returning to his already reſolued purpoſe of perfection: and conſidering that he ought of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity firſt, to overcome himſelfe, if he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the ſouldiar of Chriſt: he preſently alighted downe from his horſe, and went to kiſſe him. At what time the <hi>Leaper,</hi> reaching fotth his hand: as hoping to receiue ſomething from him: did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed teceiue money of him: and a kiſſe alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. But he being preſently gotten vp, vpon his horſe againe, and looking round about in the open field, could not eſpie the <hi>Leaper</hi> there. Being therefore repleniſhed, with admiration and ioy, he began devoutly to ſing praiſes vnto God, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing from this beginning: evermore to aſpire vnto greater perfections.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:13275:9"/>
               <p>From thenceforth he began to affect ſolitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<note place="margin">Behold his pilgrimage to holy places.</note> as beſt fitting vnto mourning and lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wherevnto with redoubled ſighes, he inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly gaue ouer himſelfe: vntill ſuch time, that after long inſtance of Praier: he obtained of our Lord, with his inclinable eare, to heare the ſame. For one day, as he was praying in a ſolitary place, &amp; through exceſſe of fervour, wholly (in manner) abſorpted vp in God: Chriſt Ieſus our Lord, vout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to appeare vnto him: faſt nailed as it were, vpon the CROSSE. At the ſight wherof, his ſoul melted within him: &amp; the memory of the Paſſion of Chriſt, was ſo efficatiouſly imprinted into his heart, that from that houre, ſo often as he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred the Crncifijng of Chriſt: he was hardly able to abſtaine from ſighes and teares, externally bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting out vpon him: as himſelfe afterward, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly reported, drawing then nigh vnto his end. For hereby the man of God, did fulwell vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that thoſe wordes of the GOSPEL: <hi>If thou wilt come after me, denie thy ſelfe, and take vp thy Croſse and followe me:</hi> were directly ſpoken vnto himſelf. From that time did he therfore put on vpon him, the ſpirit of poverty; a perfect ſence of humility; and a zealous affection of inward Piety. For wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before he could not abide the company of ſuch as were infected with <hi>Leaproſie,</hi> no, not ſo much as to ſee them, though diſtant a good way from him: nowe for the loue of Chriſt Crucified, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the wordes of the Prophet, ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as a <hi>Leaper:</hi> that he might fully contemne himſelfe: he did with a godly kind of benignity,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13275:10"/>even towards the Leapers: performe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of humility, and of all manner, of good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. For he viſited oftentimes their houſes, &amp; liberally beſtowing his almes among them; &amp; with great affection of charitable commiſeration diſdained not to kiſſe their handes, &amp; their mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes. As for poore beggars alſo, it was his deſire to beſtowe vpon them, not only his goodes, but himſelfe therewithall: ſometimes putting off his owne apparell; ſometime vnripping the ſame, &amp; ſometime, for lack of other, more conuenient meanes, cutting it in partes, to beſtowe vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> To poore Prieſts alſo, he gaue ſuccoure, with much reuerence and deuotion, eſpecially in the ornaments of the Aulter: that he might both be partaker of the honour giuen vnto God: &amp; might alſo ſupply the wants of ſuch: as were to exhibite the ſame vnto him.</p>
               <p>One time viſiting the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle with religious deuotion, and beholding a great multitude of poore people, before the doores of the Church, he being then partly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, with the ſweetnes of piety: partly allured, with the loue of pouerty, gaue vnto one of the pooreſt of them, his owne apparell, and couering himſelfe with the ragges of the poore man ſpent that whole day ioyfully in the middeſt of the poore: with an vnwonted alacrity. and ioy of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: Thereby, aſwell to contemne all wordly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as alſo to ariſe, as it were by degrees, and to clime vp, to the top of Euangelicall perfection.

But <hi>Francis</hi> being as yet but a yong ſoldier in the armie of Chriſt, when as he hearde the threatenings of them, that did perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him, and did alſo perceiue their comming at hand: being then deſirous to giue place to the force of their ſury, betooke himſelfe to a ſecret Caue, whearein cloſely concealing himſelf for a few daies, he inceſſantly beſought our Lord with aboundance of teares, that he would vouchſafe to deliver his ſoule, from his perſecutors handes: and that the good purpoſes which he had inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into his hart, he would alſo vouchſafe, to bring to a finall end and accompliſhement being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repleniſhed with a certain exceſſiue gladſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, he began to accuſe himſelfe of too much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity: whervppon forſaking his caue, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting away all manner of feare, he tooke his way ſtraight to <hi>Aſsiſium</hi> Where being eſpied of the Cittizens, and by the change of his countenance obſerued to be wholy chaunged in minde, he was thereby of them adiudged to be out of his wittes: in ſo much as taking vp the durt and ſtones of the ſtteete, they began to throw the ſame at him, as though he had ben frantique and abſolutely made indeed. But the ſeruant of God nothing at all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied, or changed with ſo many iniuries, paſſed on as a deafe man amiddeſt them all. And When his father heard ſuch a clamourous outcrie, he alſo preſently running forth, not with a minde to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13275:12"/>free him but rather to deſtroy him: ſetting all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration quite aparte, drew him home to his houſe, where firſt with wordes. and afterwards with ſtripes and bondes he did in lamentable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner torment him. But he became thereby more prompt and couragious to proceed forward in his courſe begunne: remembring the ſaying of the Ghoſpell,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</note> that: <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſuffer perſecution for inſtice: for theirs is the Kingdome of heauen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it fell out not long after, that his Father being gone out of the Country, his mother not allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of her huſbands ſeverity, and being her ſelf quite out of hope to alter her ſonnes inflexible conſtancie, diſmiſſed him quite of his bondes, and gaue him leaue to depart. Who re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring due tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks vnto Almighty God, returned againe to the place where he was before, But his Father not finding him at his comming home, and angry with his wife, went after furiouſly to the place: purpoſing if it were paſt his power to recall him, at the leaſt yet to driue him out of the province. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Sainct <hi>Francis</hi> receaving ſtrength from God came forth of his owne acorde to meete his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all the violence of his fury notwithſtanding, affirming boldly vnto him, that he did not eſteme his fetters and ſtripes, and furthermore proteſting therewithall that for the loue of Chriſt hee was ready ioyfully to fuſteyne all manner of afflictions and evils whatſoever, Wherevpon his Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inraged as hauing now no hope to recall his ſonne, converted all his care to recover the mony? which being found at lenght in a litle windowe,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13275:12"/>his fury was in ſome ſorte appeaſed, the thriſt of cove touſnes, beeing (as it were) by a draught of mony alayd. After this his Father, endevoured to bring his ſonne (thus diſpoyled of his mony?) before the Biſhop of the City, that in his preſence he might renounce his right vnto all his Fathers poſſeſſions, &amp; might alſo reſtore vnto him all that ever he had. To the performance wherof, the true lover of poverty ſhewed himſelfe both ready and willing. For co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming before the Biſhop, without any delay, or lingring whatſoeuer, neither contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting with wordes, nor yet did he expect any to be ſpoken vnto him: preſently putting off eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his garments, reſtored them to hisfather. At what time the holy man was founde to haue a ſhirte of hearecloth next to his ſkinne, Which he concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnder his more delicate apparell. Furthermore out of an admirable fervour of ſpirit caſting off al his apparell, he ſtood all naked before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: and addreſſed his ſpeach vnto his Father, thus: <hi>Hitherto haue I called you my Father in earth, but from hence forth I shall ſecurely ſay: Our Father which art in heaven: in Whom I haue repoſed all my treaſure: &amp; haue ſetled the whole ſumme of my hope and confidence.</hi> The Biſhop beholding all this, and admiring ſuch an exceſſiue fervour of pietie, in the man of God aroſe forth with from where hee ſate: and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him in his armes with teares, as hee was a good and godly man, did alſo wrappe him in his owne garment? commaunding his ſervantes, to giue vnto him ſomething to cover his naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But they gaue him a poore and baſe mantell.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:13275:13"/>which they had of a husband man, that ſerved the Biſhop: which he accepting with great thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes, did with a peice of lime which he founde in the place, mark vpon it the forme of the Croſſe with his owne hand, faſhioning it, as a fit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering for a poore man crucified, and litle better than naked. Thus therefore was the ſervant of the higheſt King, left all in nakedneſſe, that he might follow his naked Lord crucified, whom he ſo dearely loved, in this manner fortifying him ſelfe with the Croſſe, that he might committ his ſoule to the ſecure harboure of ſalvation, by the which he might ſafely eſcape the ſhippwracke of this tempeſtuous world.</p>
               <p>From thence forth this contemner of the world being altogether freed from the bondes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires: forſaking the Citty, did with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and freedome of minde, betake himſelfe vnto the ſecret parts of the deſert: that there in ſolitarines &amp; ſilence, he might attend vnto the miſticall ſecrets by Almighty God from aboue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled vnto him. And as this devout ſervant of God paſſed by a certaine wood ſinging praiſes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God with great ioye and exultation: a ſorte of thieues came ruſhing out of a ſecret place vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon him. Who demaunding of him with firce behaviour, what he was, the man of God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great confidence, and not without an inſtinct alſo of prophecy, I am the preacher of the great King. But they heaping blowes vpon him, caſt him into a pitt filled vp with ſnowe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto him: Ly thou there Clowne, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:13275:13"/>of God. But ſo ſoone as they were departed,
<note place="margin">Behold againe his pilgrimag to holy places.</note> he got him ſpeedily out of the pit againe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marveilouſely poſſeſſed with ioy, began with a lowder voice to ſounde forth throughout the woodes, his ſonges of praiſe vnto the Creatour of all. And comming to a certaine religious houſe thereby, he aſked almes as a beggar: and recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame as one vnknowen and diſpyſed. Fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence going on along, he came to <hi>Eugubium:</hi> Where being of an old frend of his both knowen and entertained, he receaued a poore coate of his guifte, as one of the poore litle ones of Chriſt. From thence, being a louer of all manner of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, he applied himſelf to the leapers: &amp; remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with them, ſeruing them moſt diligently for the loue of God. He waſhed their feet, bounde vp their vlcers, wrung out the corruption of their ſoares, and wiped away the filthines of them. He alſo kiſſed their running botches with admirable devotion, being now in the way shortly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an Euangelicall Phiſitian. By theſe meanes he obtained ſo great power of God, that he wrought wonderfull effects in the purging both of ſpyrituall and corporall diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Among many of that kinde, here will I now make reporte of one, which befeell, when the ſame man of God hade afterwardes begunne to be of greater note in the world, there was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Country of <hi>Spolerum,</hi> who had his mouth &amp; iawe bone miſerably eaten away with an horrible diſeaſe ſuch as no art of Phyſicke was able to cure: wherefore having bin to viſite the Church
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13275:14"/>of the Apoſtles to craue the help of their meritts,
<note place="margin">S. Francis repaired three Churches with the almes of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a good work and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God.</note> it happened that in the way of his rerurne from pilgrimage, he met with this holy ſervant of God. At what tyme when as he would for very deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue kiſſed the footeſteeps of his feete, the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, in no ſorte permitting the ſame, kiſſed the mouth of him that would gladely haue kiſſed his feet. But ſo ſoone as Sainct Francis, had with a marveillous piety, once with his ſacred mouth touched that horrible and loath ſome ſoare, the malice forth with of the diſeaſe departed, and the diſeaſed man preſently attained his wished health and recouery. Herein I know not whether more to admire, either the perfection of ſo great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in ſo charitable a kiſſe, or the excellencie of his vertue, in ſo wonderfull a miracle.</p>
               <p>But let vs comme to our intended purpoſe: this holy man Saint <hi>Francis</hi> being firmely eſtablishe in Chriſtian humility, recalled againe to his due o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to be exhibited in performance of the worke from the Croſſe enioyned vnto him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the repairing of Saint <hi>Damians</hi> Church &amp; as a true obedient ſervant he returneth back to <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> that at the leaſt by beginning, he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paſſe ſo much as might ſuffice to performe the commaundement of God. For which cauſe put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting aſide all bashfullnes for the loue of Chriſt crucified, he was willingly contented to begg of them, amongſt whome he was wont to liue in great aboundance: offering his wearied bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, now waſted much with faſting, to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng of heavy ſtones towards the repaire of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13275:14"/>ding. This Church therefore being finally repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, by the help of God &amp; good devotion of the Cittyſens, leaſt that his hody ſhould after labour waxe wanton co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning idleneſſe, he ſeetled himſelfe to the repayring of a certaine other Church dedicated to the holy Apoſtle <hi>S. Peter</hi> the ſame being diſtant ſom what further off from the Citty: thereof he made rather his choice, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of ſpeciall devotion without of the purity of ſincer faith he bare to the prince of the Apoſtles. This Church being at the lenght finiſhed: he came vnto the place called <hi>Portiuncula:</hi> wherin was a Church builded to the bleſſed virgin Mother of God, but at that time decaied deſolate &amp; not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of any. Which the man of God ſeing, to be thus forſake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: did for the fervent devotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he carried towards this B. mother begane to make his daily reſidence there, for the repayring of the ſame Church alſo. And perceiving that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the name therof, which was from ancient time, called S. <hi>Mary</hi> of Angels, there appeared oftentimes Evangelicall viſions: there did he ſett vp his reſt, and finall purpoſe of aboade, as well for the reuerence of the Angels, as for the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler loue which he bare to the Mother of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This place the holy man loved aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of the world. For here he beganne in humility, heere he proceeded in integritie, heere he made his end in felicity: this place at his death he commended to his brethren, as moſt dere to the bleſſed virgin. Of this place cerraine devout brother did a litle before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:13275:15"/>behold a viſion very worthy of relation. There appeared vnto him an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of blinde men, ſtanding within the Compaſſe of this Church: all of them having their faces di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected towards heaven, and their knees bowed downe to the grounde: who ſtrectching for the their handes on high, cried out to God in pittiful manner, deſiring him of mercy, and reinioying of their ſightes. And behold there came a great light from heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which ſpreading it ſelf through them all, reſtored vnto enery one of them theire perfect ſightes, and healthe, according as they had before deſired. This is the place wheare <hi>S. Francis</hi> by the inſtinct of divine revelation, beganne the order of the Friers Minors. For by the appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Gods heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly providence, wherby the ſervant of Chriſt was directed in all things, he erected three materiall Churchs, before the beginning of his Order he did apply himſelf to the preaching of the Ghoſpell, that he might not only aſcend, as it were by degrees, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> things ſenſible, vnto things intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, &amp; from matters of leſſer moment to things of farre greater perfection: but that he might alſo foretell, as it were in a miſtery, by ſome ſenſible worke, what he was heareafter to do. For like as the triple building was repayred by means of that holy man, ſo according to the ſame, forme rule &amp; doctrine by him preſcribed, the Church of Chriſt was in three ſortes to be renewed, in a threefold triumphant armie of the elect, according as we do now ſee to be accompliſhed.</p>

His ſhoes did he therfore looſe from his feete, his ſtaffe he layd a ſide, his wallet he reiected, and mony he vtterly abandoned? rhus reſting contented with one only coate, refuſing alſo his letherne belt, in ſteade of a girdle he toke

From this time the man of God by divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beganne to be a ſtudious emulator of Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall perfection, and to invite others vnto Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with him. His ſpeeches were in no wiſe vaine, neither yet ſuch as might Miniſter cauſe of laughter, but evermore full fraught with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of the Holy Ghoſt, penetrating even into the ſecret partes of the harte: by force whereof he wrought not a litle aſtoniſhment in the mindes all ſuch as heard him. He preached alwaies peace, vnto the people, and in the beginning of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, he was wonte in this manner to ſalute them, ſaiyng: <hi>Our Lord giue his peace vnto you.</hi> For this manner of ſalutation he learned of God: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as himſelf afterwards affirmed. And there vpon it came to paſſe, that according to the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophet, himſelfe alſo being inſpired with the ſpirit of propheſy, he did denounce peace he did preach ſalvation, and did with healthfull admonition, aſſociate very many vnto the true peace: euen ſuch as had binne before time diſioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much from the favour of Chriſte, and had thereby ſtraied farr away from the porte of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Now therefore when this holy ſervant of God did growe to be better knowen vnto many aſwell for the truth of his ſincere doctrine, as of his life: certaine other man alſo moved by his example,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13275:16"/>beganne to be animated and ſtirred vp vnto Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and reiected all the impediments of this world, that they might be conioyned vnto him, both in habite and life, The firſt of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, was the venerable man, <hi>Bernardus</hi> who be the ſpecial vocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God, merited to be the firſt borne of the bleſſed Father aſwell in priority of time, as in priviledge of holy converſation. For he having had experience of the holineſſe of the ſeruant of Chriſt, and purpoſing by his example perfectly to contemne the world, demaunded of him dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the better performance of his purpoſe.

For being afterwards moſt rarely exerciſed, in heauenly vertus according as the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, had foretold of himſelf, although he were a ſimple and vnlearned man, yet was he exalted, vnto the top of Celeſtiall contemplation. For contine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing long time togeather without intermiſſion, intentive vnto heavenly actions, he was raviſhed alſo with ſo frequent exceſſe of contemplation in God: as I my ſelf have with mine eies obſerved, that he was eſteemed rather to haue led the life of Angels, then of men, though living and couer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing among men.</p>
               <p>Aboute the ſame very time vnto a certaine Prieſt of <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> named Sylueſter, a man of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt life and converſation, our Lord vouchſafed to ſhew a viſion, very worthy to be remembred For finding in himſelf, an eſpeciall loathing and avertion from the manner &amp; life of S. <hi>Francis</hi> and his brethren, leaſt that he might haply be indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered for the raſhnes of his iudgement, thus was he viſited by the favour of Gods heauenly grace. He beheld in his ſleep the whole Citty of <hi>Aſsiſium</hi> to be environed rownde with a mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrous Dragon, by reaſon of the vnmeaſurable hugenes whereof
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:13275:17"/>the whole country ſeemed to be in danger of vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſt and diſtruction. After this he might ſee a certaine Croſſe of gold, iſſueing forth of the mouth of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> the topp where of reached vnto heauen, and the armes to the vtter moſt bounds of the worlde: at the glittering aſpect wherof, that ougly and horrible Dragon, was vtterly put to flight, This viſion being three times in this manner repreſented vnto him, he therevpon eſteeming it as the very Oracle of God, declared the ſame in order to the man of God, and his brethren: and it was not long after, but himſelfe alſo leaving the world, did with ſuch perfection adheare vnto the footeſteeps of Chriſt, that the life by him ledd in the order, gaue good credit and authority, to the viſion he had ſeene in the world. Vpon the report and publication whereof, no whitt was the man of God ezalted in humaine glory: but acknowledging the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God and the greatnes of his goodnes, he was more and more incouraged to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the crafte of the auncient enemye, and therewithall to preach and extoll the glory of the Croſſe of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But it befell vnto him vpon a day, that walking in a certaine ſolitary place, and there recounting with himſelfe his yeares miſpent: as he did in the bitternes of his harte bewaile them, the gladſome comfort of the Holy-Ghoſt comming then vpon him, he was fully certified of the plenarie remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all his offences. And being afterwardes rapt as it were aboue himſelfe, and having his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding marveilouſly inlightened, he evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13275:18"/>perceyved, what great matters were in tyme to come to be fall vnto himſelfe and his whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genie after him. Whervpon returning vnto his brethren: Be of good comfort (quoth he) my moſt dearely beloved, and reioyce in our Lord; &amp; be in no wiſe eyther ſad or ſorrowfull, for that yee be but few in number, neyther yet be yee deſmayed eyther out of myne, or your owne ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity: for ſo much as our Lord hath certainely revealed vnto me, that he will make vs increaſe to a great and mighty companie; and will with the ſweet bleſſing of his heavenly grace, multiply and augmente our noumber many and ſundrie wayes.</p>
               <p>At the ſame time alſo another devout man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the religion among them, whereby the iſſue of the man of God did now amounte vnto ſeaven. Then the good Father calling all his children a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him: and ſpeaking many things vnto them of the kingdome of God, of the contempt of the world, of the denying of their owne will, and of the chaſticement of the body, withall declared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them his purpoſe to ſend them into the foure partes of the world. For now the holy ſimplicity, of the holy Father, having brought forth ſeaven children, did alſo deſire to beget the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the faithfull vnto Chriſt our Lord, by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them to the mournefull works of Pennance. Go your waies (quoth he ſweet father to his wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved children) and denouncing peace vnto men: preache vnto them Pennance for the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſinnes.

               <p>Now the ſervant of Chriſt, perceyving that the noumber of his brethren. was by litle &amp; litle daily encreaſed. wrote for himſelfe and them, in playne wordes, a rule and forme of life, wherein hauing laid the obſeruance of the Holy Ghoſpell, for an indiſſoluble foundation, he had alſo inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therevnto certaine other few things, ſuch as ſeemed moſt neceſſary, for an vniforme manner &amp; courſe of liuing. And deſiring to haue the ſame approued by the Chiefe Paſtour of the Church: be determined with that ſmall company of ſimple aſſociates, to take his way to the Sea Apoſtolique, repoſing all his truſt in the only direction and help of God. Who from his heauenly ſeate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the finall end of his deſire, vouchſafed by the ſhewing of this manner of viſion vnto him, to reare vp the mindes of his companions, otherwiſe not a litle aſtoniſhed, out of the conſideraation of their owne ſimplicity. For, it ſeemed vnto him, that paſſing by a certaine way, he beheld ſtanding nigh vnto him a goodly Tree of ſtately height &amp; loftines: which as he approached more nigh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and did ſtand vnder the ſame in admiration of the height thereof. he was ſodeinly by the power of God, lifted vp into ſo great a height of the aire, that he did not only reach to the very top therof, but did alſo with great facility bow it downe, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the vpper moſt parte, to the grounde.

But when he was come to the Court of Kome, and brought before the face of the ſupreame Biſhop, the Vicar of Chriſt being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> walking in the Pallace of <hi>Laterane,</hi> in the place which is called <hi>Speculum,</hi> and there poſſeſſed with profounde meditations, repelled the ſeruant of Chriſt, as a man vnknowen, not without ſome ſhew alſo of diſcontentment. Who humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of the doores, in the night follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this manner of revelation was by Almighty God made to the Pope himſelfe.

And marueiling with himſelfe what this viſion ſhould meane: his minde was illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by the worke of God, that by this palme tree that poore man was ſignified, whom he had the day before reiected.

The Vicar of Chriſt, Pope <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> the third, being a man of ſingular wiſedom
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:13275:20"/>obſerving in the man of God. an admirable puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a ſimple minde, the conſtancy alſo of his purpoſe. and the fiery zeale of his holy deſire: embraced this poore one of Chriſt with the loue of his harte, being much inclined in minde, to yeeld his favourable aſſent to the humble petition of this holy man. But yet deferred to ratifie the requeſts of the poore ſervant of Chriſt: for that his demaund ſeemed vnto ſome of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls,</hi> to be both a matter of novelty, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of difficultie, beyond the meaſure of mans ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.</p>
               <p>But it happened at that tim to be among the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls,</hi> a reverend man called <hi>Dominus Ioannes de ſancto Paulo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Sabina,</hi> a lover of all holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and an eſpecially helper of the poore ſervats of Chriſte, who inflamed with the ſpirit of God, delivered his mind in the matter before the <hi>Pope</hi> and his brethren, to this effect. If we ſhall ſaith he, deny the requeſt of this poore man, as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter either of novelty, or of too much difficulty, wheras he requireth none other thing, but a form of Euangelicall life, to be confirmed vnto him: we haue iuſt cauſe to feare, leaſt therein we doe offend againſt the Goſpell of Chriſt. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall aſſirme that any thing which is either newe, vnreaſonable, or impoſible to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is contained within the obſervance of Eua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall perfection, or within the vowe which is made thereof: he is manifeſtly convinced of blaſphemy againſt Chriſt himſelfe, the very Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Goſpell, Thus much being ſpoken
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:13275:20"/>in this behalf: the Succeſſour of the Apoſtle S. <hi>Peter,</hi> turning himſelfe towards the ſervant of Chriſt ſaid vnto him, Offer vp thy praiers deere ſonne, vnto Chriſte, that by thee he may vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſhewe his will vnto vs, to the end that it being once, more certainely knowen, we may the more ſecurely condiſcende to thy god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſires. Wherevpon the ſervant of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God, beſtowing himſelfe now wholy in praier, by his inſtant devotion obtayned to knowe, both what him-ſelfe ſhoulde exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly diſcloſe, and what the <hi>Pope</hi> ſhould inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourly conceyue. For having related a parable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he had receaved the ſame from God, of a rich and mighty King, that willingly mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with a beautifull, though a very poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and of a noble iſſue begott betwixt them bearing liuely reſemblance of the KING his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in that reſpect very worthy to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at the KINGES owne table: this alſo by way of interpretation hee therevnto adioyned. Wee haue no cauſe to feare, that the Sonnes and heires of the Eternall KING, ſhall periſhe and die for hunger, who beeing borne of a poore Mother, by the power of the HOLIE GHOST to the image of CHRIST their KING, are alſo to bee gotten vnto him in a poore religion by the ſpirite of povertie. For if the KING of HEAVEN doe promiſe an eternall Kingdome to them that followe him: howe much more will hee provide them of things of neceſſity which he giveth indifferently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:13275:21"/>not only to the good, but alſo to the wicked: This parable and the meaning thereof, when the Vicar of Chriſt had dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly heard &amp; obſerved, he mary vailed greatly thereat: &amp; knew for certain, that it was vndoubtedly. Chriſt himſelfe, who covertly ſpake in the man.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. For he had ſeene in his ſleepe as himſelfe reported, the Church of <hi>Laterane,</hi> to be in preſent danger, now forthwith to fall to the grounde: the which a certain poore ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; of mean ſtature, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptible to behold, putting his own back vnder it did ſo preſerue fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling.

Wherfore he graunted his requeſt, &amp; promiſed to graunt yet more vnto him, he approued his Rule, he gaue him in Charge to vndertake the preaching of pennance, &amp; for all the lay brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to that were aſſociate the ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt he cauſed them to haue litle crownes made that they might freely preach the word of God.</p>

               <p>After this, S. FRANCIS, the Paſtor of that litle flock, being guided and directed by the grace of God, conducted this poore number of twelue brethren, to the Church of Saint <hi>Mary of Portiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And in this place alſo, being made a preacher of the Goſpell, he went about preaching through the Citties and townes: <hi>Not in the learned words of humane wiſedom,</hi> but in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the ſpirit, denowcing the Kingdome of God.

For many, both men and women, inflamed with the zeale of his preaching, ſerving our Lord in the Chaſtitie of wedlock, according to the forme receaved, of the ſervant of God; did binde themſelves vnto new lawes of Pennance, whoſe manner of living the ſaid ſervant of Chriſt decreed to be named <hi>The Order of the brethren of Pennance.</hi> For, as the way of pennance, is one and the very ſame vnto all ſuch as deſire to come vnto heaven, ſo likewyſe this order,

               <p>Even now alſo, divers Virgins were by him converted vnto perpetuall chaſtity, among which Saint <hi>Clare</hi> that notable Virgin and moſt deare to God, was the firſt plant and moſt beautifull bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of all the reſt: who as as pure ſpringing flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer gaue a ſweet ſavour of holyneſſe; and glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered forth her beames as a bright ſhining ſtar. ſhe being now glorified with God in heaven, is
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13275:24"/>worthely honored of the Church in earth: who being the daughter in Chriſt, of the holy poore Father Saint FRANCIS, did alſo become the Mother of the poore: And many not only moved with devotion, but inflamed with deſire of Chriſtian perfection, contemning the vanity of wordly things, did follow the ſteeps of Holy S. <hi>Francis.</hi> Who increaſing daily more &amp; more were quickly ſpreede forth to the end of the world. For that ſame holy poverty, which was the only thing they deſired to carrie with them, for the defray of their charges, made them evermore ready, vnto all obedience, ſtrong in ſuſtaining of labours, and nimble in proſecuting their iourneis. And for ſo much as they poſſeſſed no earthly thing, nothing did they loue nothing, did they feare to looſe: but were in every place ſecure, never aſſailed with feare, never diſtracted with care, wherby living as men in every point free from all manner of trouble of minde, they had patience in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance, of their morning and nightly ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
               <p>Many and ſundry reproaches they ſuſtained in diuerſe parts of the world, as men conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptible and vnknowen: but the loue of the Goſpell of Chriſt, had endewed them with ſo perfect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that they ſought in thoſe places rather to be, were they might ſuffer perſecution in body. than where, vpon obſervation of their vnfained holineſſe, they might haue occaſion to glory in the favour of the world. And even that very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nury of all things which they continually ſuſtayned
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13275:25"/>ſeemed vnto them a ſuperabou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant plenty: meane while that according to the wiſemans Councell. <hi>In ſteed of a great thing, the leaſt did contente them.</hi> For ſome of the brethren comming into the infidells countries, it happened that a certaine <hi>Saracin,</hi> moved with pittie, offered them mony for their neceſſary foode: which he perceiving them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, wondered not a litle thereat, ſeeing them notwithſtauding to be both poore and needy.

O ineſtimable price of poverty, by the admirable force whereof, even Barbarours cruelty, was chaunged into ſo great a ſweetnes of mercy, Wherefore it is a thing moſt horrible and a wickednes vnexcuſable, for a Chriſtian man to tread vppon ſo pretious a pearle which an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell <hi>Saracin</hi> held in ſo great a reverence.</p>
               <p>About this time <hi>Moricus,</hi> a Religious man of the Order called <hi>Cruciferi,</hi> being miſerably affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in an Hoſpital neare to <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> with a long and greivouſe diſeaſe, through the violent force whereof, the Phiſitions were in vtter deſpaire of his recoverie: made humble requeſt to the man of God, by a meſſenger ſent for purpoſe, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant deſire, that he would vouchſafe to pray for him.

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13275:25"/>made, taking cartaine crummes of bread into his hand, and mingling the ſame with oyle, taken from, out of the Lamp which burned before the Altar of the Bleſſed virgin, brought it at lenght, as it were, to a certaine kinde of electuary, which he ſent vnto the ſicke man, by the handes of his brethren, ſaying, Beere ye this medicine vnto our brother MORICVS: where by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of Chriſt, will not only reſtore him vnto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health againe, but will make of him a ſtrong and hardy warriour, and ſhall further adioyne him perpetually, vnto our troupe and company: No ſooner had this ſicke, man taſted of that exquiſit medecine, made &amp; confected by the Holy Ghoſt his invention, but riſing vp forth with, now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly whole and well, he obtained of God ſo much ſtrength both of body &amp; minde, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a litle while after, entring into the Religion of the holy man he was contended with one only ſlender coate,
<note place="margin">Behold the wonderfull abſtinence of the holy man who for a long ſpace taſted neither bread nor wine and wasfed only with rawe meats.</note> vnder which alſo he ware for long time together, a coate of maile next to his skinne, &amp; vſed no other diet than raw meates, as hearbes fruits and ſuch like other things as he gathered v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the earth: not taſting for many and ſoundrie years, either of bread or wine.

               <p>And as the merrits of the vertue of theſe litle ones of Chriſt did daily more and more increaſe ſo the ſweet ſmell of their good opinion, ſpreading it ſelf ronde about, drew many out of divers parts of the world, to come in perſon to ſee the holy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13275:26"/>Father. Among whom there was a curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of ſecular ſonges, who having binne for that cauſe crowned by the Emperour, and called the king of verſes determined to go ſee this man of God, the contemner of wordly things. And finding him preaching in a certaine Monaſtery, at the Caſtle of Saint SEVERINVS: the hand of our Lord comming then vpon him, be beheld Saint FRANCIS the preacher of the Croſſe of Chriſt, enſigned with two ſwordes, one overthwarr the other in the forme of a Croſſe, the one of them ſtretched along from his head to his feete, and the other, Croſſe-wiſe along his breaſt, from on hand to the other. Wherby although he knew not the contenance of the ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Chriſt: yet was he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured that this very man was he, by the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable apparence of ſo great a miracle. At the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain aſpect whereof being much amaſed he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to propoſe vnto himſelfe better things in his minde: and being at the lenght compunct by the force of his words, no leſſe than if he had bin ſtricken through with the ſword of the ſpirit, iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueyng out of his mouth, vtterly contemning all ſecular pompes he conioyned himſelfe in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, with the bleſſed Father. Wherevpon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, ſeeing him to be perfectly converted, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the trouble of the world, to the peace of Chriſt, called him by the name of <hi>Frater Pacificus.</hi> He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward increaſing in al holineſſe, before ſuch time as he was made provinciall Miniſter in <hi>France</hi> for he was the firſt that bare that office there merrited once, and againe, to ſee the greeke letter <hi>T.</hi> in

This ſigne the holy man did reverence with great affection, this ſigne he did commend with frequent ſpeeches: and in his letters which he vſually diſpatched, he evermore with his owne hand ſubſcribed the ſame:
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ezech.</hi> 9.4</note> as if all his ſtudy were to make the ſigne T according to the ſaieing of the Prophet vpon the foreheades of them that ſighed and mourned, and were vnfainedly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now when the number of brethren, was in proceſſe of time increaſed; the carefull Paſtor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to call them together vnto a general Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to beholden in the place of our Lady of <hi>Portiuncula:</hi> that in the meaſure of divine diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, he might giue vnto every one his portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of obedience, in the land of their poverty. Where although there were great penurie, and the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſometimes came together aboue fiue thow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in number: yet by the help of Gods mercie they had ſufficient foode; together with health of body, and aboundance of ſpirituall ioy. But for ſo much as he could not be in body preſent at the provinciall Chapiters, he was therefore in ſpirit, by the diligent care of his governement: by the inſtancy of prayer; and by the efficacy, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction; evermore preſent, at them: notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that ſometimes, by the marvailous po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and worke of God, he did viſibly appeare. For as Saint <hi>Anthony</hi> that worthy preacher, who
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13275:27"/>is now a notable Confeſſour of Chriſt, was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Chapter at <hi>Arles</hi> of the title of the Croſſe: <hi>Ieſus of Nazareth King of the Iewes:</hi> a certaine brother of approued vertue, called <hi>Monaldus,</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, as the will of God was towardes the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houſe doore; ſawe with is corporall eies the bleſſed Father Saint FRANCIS lifted vp alofte in the aire, ad bleſſing his brethren with his handes ſtretched out as it were in the forme of a Croſſe. At which very time all the brethren did feele the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to be repleniſhed with ſo great &amp; vnvſual-a conſolation of ſpirit, that the inward teſtimony which they felt in their hartes did ſufficiently ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure them of the vndoubted preſence of the holy Father: though afterwardes it was, not only by evident ſignes, but alſo by the ſaid holy Fathers owne wordes, externally confirmed. And well it may be believed that the ſame power of Almighty God, which granted the devout and holy Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Saint <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> to be preſent at the in tom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the glorious Biſhop Saint <hi>Martin,</hi> to the end that he might with devout reverence, honor the devout Biſhop deceaſed: did alſo by an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall favour, preſent his ſervant Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> at the ſermon of his true preacher Saint, <hi>Anthony:</hi> that he might approue the words of truth: thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, of the Croſſe of Chriſt, whereof himſelfe was a continuall bearer, and a moſt faithfull ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</p>
               <p>But the Order being now great amplified &amp; augmented, he did greatly deſire, that the forme and rule therof by Pope <hi>Innocenci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13275:27"/>might be <hi>Honorius</hi> his ſucceſſor, for ever be ratified and confirmed. and even then he was by Almighty God admoniſhed, with this manner of revelation. It ſeemed vnto him that he was ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering vp from the earth, certaine moſt excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſmall and ſlender crummes of bread, by him to be diſtributed among a great many hungry bre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thren of his, that ſtoode in expectance rownde aboute him, And fearing to diſtribute ſo ſmalle crummes, leaſt perhaps they ſhould fall out of his handes, he heard a voice from aboue, ſaing vnto him: <hi>Francis,</hi> make one haſt of all the crummes, and giue vnto them that will eate. Vnto which voice he ſhewing himſelfe obedient, whoſoever did not receiue the diſtribution devoutly, or did make light of the guift already receaved, were preſently marked with a leaprous infection. All which the holy man did the next morning after, relate vnto his brethren; ſorrowing much, that he could not vnderſtand the miſtery of the viſion But the next day following, as he perſiſted watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in praier, he heard a voice from heaven ſpeke vnto him, <hi>Francis,</hi> the crummes which thou ſaweſt in the night paſt, are the wordes of the Goſpell, the hoſt is the Rule, and the leaprouſie iniquity. Being therefore deſirous, before he ſought the confirmation of his Rule. to reduce the ſame as being hitherto more largely compiled out of ſundry parts of the Ghoſpell, vnto a more compendious forme and methode, according as the viſion did purporte vnto him: he went vpp with two of his companions into a certaine hill,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13275:28"/>wherevnto he was by the Holy Ghoſt conducted,
<note place="margin">He faſted with bread &amp; water.</note> and there contenting himſelfe with bread &amp; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, during the time of his faſt he cauſed the ſame to be written, according to that which the ſpirit of God ſuggeſted vnto him, as he was yet perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in fervent prayer. Which being there by him, in this manner finiſhed, and himſefe now comming downe from the montaine, he gaue the ſame to his Vicar to keepe: who within few daies, confeſſing himſelfe to haue loſt it, by fault of negligence, the holy man went againe, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, into the ſolitary place of the deſert, &amp; preſently renewed the ſame againe: as if he had taken the wordes, from out of the mouth of God. And ſhortly after obtained, according to his owne deſire to haue the ſame confirmed, by the foreſaid Pope HONORIVS: in the eight yeare of his Popedome. Wherevpon taking occaſion with great fervency to perſwade his brethren a new to the obſervance of the rule, he avowed vnto them that he had not thereinto inſerted any thing out of his owne induſtrie, but had ſimply and plainly written downe all &amp; every point, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in ſuch ſorte as had binne from God revealed vnto him.

If we were inwardly toucht by fervent deſire with the flame of the heavenly cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try, we ſhould eaſily be able to indure this eternall colde. He
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:13275:29"/>could not abide ſoftnes of apparell, but aſperous clothing he much eſteemed; affirming that S, <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was in that reſpecte commended by the mouth of God himſelfe. And therefore, if at time he found any kinde of eaſefulnes in ſuch garmens as had bene given vnto him, he vſed to weare litle cords into the inner ſide therof alluding vnto the words of truth, that ſoftnes of apparell was not to beſought for Cottages of the poore, but in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces pallaces For he had learned by certaine expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riece, that the divels are terrefied by aſperitie: but by delicious niceneſſe, more forciblely animated to rentation.

For immediately after this,

Which ſo ſoone as this lover of chaſtitie did we forſee, putting of his coate, he beganne very feircly to beate him ſelfe with a corde, ſaying goe to brother Aſſe, thus doth it beſeme thee to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,

Thy coate ſerveth for Religion, it beareth the badge of holineſſe: for it is lawfull for anie one that is delighted in vnlawful luſt, to intrude vpon it: if any whither thou wouldeſt goe, then goe thy waies. Moreouer alſo, being animated with a moſt wonderfull feruour of ſpirite,
<note place="margin">The whole purpoſ of this holy man was to purg his mind of all vices.</note> opening the doore of his Cell, he went his way forth into the garden: and there caſting downe his poore naked bodie, into the deepe ſnowe, he caught the ſame in his handes, and made thereof, ſeaven heapes: which being orderly placed before him, thus did he then ſpeake to his outwarde man: loe here (ſaith he) the bigger of theſe is thy wiſe, theſe other foure, are thy two ſonns, and thy two daughters, and theſe two that remaine, are thy ſervantes thy man and thy maied, which thou oughteſt to haue to waite vpon thee.

But if the manifolde care, of theſe ſeaven be over moleſtful vnto thee: then ſerue thine one and onely Lord alone, with heedfull diligence.

               <p>He did moreover teach,

               <p>Idlenes alſo, he taught to be eſchewed, as the very ſinke and common receptacle, of al naughty thoughts: shewing by his owne example, that the rebelliouſe and ſlothful fleſh, was to be kept vnder by cotinuall diſcipline, and profitable la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Wherefore he called his body, his brother Aſſe, for that it was to carrie hevie burthens, and to be beaten with manie and frequent ſtrips: and not otherwiſe to be fed then with baſe &amp; meane diet. If he ſaw anie idle or loitring perſon, to liue vpon the fruites of others mens labours, this man
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:13275:32"/>he called brother flie, for that ſuch an one doing no good him ſelfe, but impairing the good la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of other men, maketh himſelfe vile and abhominable, to all ſortes of people. Wherefore he vſed ſometimes this manner of ſaying: I will that my bretheren occupie themſelues, in labour and exerciſe: leaſt that being inclined to idlenes, either theire harte or tongue, doe wander after vnlawful thinges. For his will and care was to haue ſilence by his bretheren obſerved, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſcript &amp; rule of the Goſpel: which admoniſheth men at al tims with all dilligence to abſtaine from al maner of idle words, as being to render an accompte thereof at the day of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente. Wherefore if he did finde any of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, to be accuſtomed vnto idle and vaine wordes, he did there vpon, very sharpely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, affirming that modeſt taciturnitie, was both a ſecure preſervation of a pure hart, &amp; like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a vertue of no ſmalle accompt: conſidering that <hi>Death &amp; life, are ſaid to be in the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds of the tongue,</hi> not ſo much in regard of the taſte, as of the ſpeach</p>
               <p>But although he endevored alwaies to induce his bretheren vnto auſteritie of life: yet he appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not that ſtrcikt kinde of ſeveritie, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not from the bowels of devotion, neither yet was ſeaſoned with the wholeſome ſalte of diſcretion. For, when as one of his brethren, was vpon a night; through too much extremity of abſtinence, greatly vexed with famine, &amp; could not in that reſpect, take any naturall reſt: the good and carrefull Paſtor preceiving that one of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:13275:32"/>his ſheep was then in preſent danger of periſhing, called the brother forth with vnto him, and ſet, him bread before him, and to the ende all baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullnes, might be away removed: he firſt began to eate therof himſelfe, and ſo with ſweetneſſe invited him, to do the like. Whereby the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being well incouraged, reiected shame and willingly tooke his meate: very much reioicing, that by the wiſe and provident condiſcending of the prudent Paſtor he had happily eſcaped the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his body, and had alſo received, no ſmall example of edification, when the morning was come, the man of God calling his brethren alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, after relation made vnto them of what had chanced in the night, adioyned alſo this heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful admonition vnto them. Let charity, ſaith he, &amp; not meat, my brethren, be a patterne and example vnto you. Furthermore he taught them to follow iſcretion as the Chariot man of al vertues, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it not that diſcretion, which the flesh doth adviſe, but that very ſame, which Chriſt hath taught: whoſe moſt holy life, is vnd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ubredly knowen to be the moſt exact paterne of all perfection.</p>
               <p>And for ſo much as it is not poſſible for a man invironed with the infirmity of his fleſhely bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſo perfectly to followe, the vnſpoted lambe of Chriſt crucified for vs vpon the Croſſe, but that he ſhall daily gather ſome filthy Dreggs of ſinne; vpon this cauſe, he avowed by vnfallible docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they who do with vigilancy aſpire to the perfection of life, ought daily to cleance the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues with ſtreames of teares. For though him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13275:33"/>had already attained vnto a wonderfull puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both of heart and body: yet ceaſed he not with showers of teares, continually to cleance the eies of his minde, not much regarding the loſſe of his corporall eies. For having gotten through continuall weeping, amoſt daungerons imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his eies, &amp; being for that cauſe by the Phiſitian adviſed, in any wiſe to abſtaine from teares, vnleſſe he would vtterly looſe his ſight, the holy man made anſweare vnto him, Brother Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian, we muſt not in any ſorte, for the love of that light, which is common aſwell to flies, as to vs men; in any ſmall degree, refuſe the viſitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of that light, which is of everlaſting continew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: conſidering that it is not the ſpirit, which hath for vſe of the flesh, receiued the benefit of light, but contrary wiſe, it is the flesh, which for the vſe and ſervice of the ſpirit hath receyued the ſame at the bountifull hand of God. And therefore he did rather chuſe, to looſe his corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eieſight: than by repreſſing the devotion of his ſpirit, to hinder thoſe comfortable ſtreames of teares, wherby the inwarde eie is cleared, that it may by able to ſee God.</p>
               <p>But being ypon a time, councelled by the Phiſitians, and therewithall, inſtantly perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his brethren; to ſuffer himſelfe to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a certaine kinde of Cawtery: the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God humbly aſſented therevnto: the rather in that he perceyued, it would aſwell be healthfull as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe painefull vnto him. The Surgion therefore, being ſent for, came; and put his iron inſtrument
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13275:33"/>into the fire, to worke the cure. But the ſervant of Chriſt, chearing vp his body, which was now ſommewhat daunted with feare, beganne in this manner, as to a frind, to ſpeake vnto the fire, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, My brother fire, whom Almighty God hath created of a moſt exquiſite ſeemelineſſe, full of fotce notably beautifull, and profitable, be favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable at this houre, be curteous now vnto me. I beſeech the great &amp; omnipotent Lord who hath created thee, ſo to temper the violence of thy burning heat, that burning with ſweeteneſſe, I may be able to endure thee. This praier indeed, he made the ſigne of the Croſſe right over againſt the red hotte iron inſtrument: and ſo remained after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards without all kind of feare or quailing. Then was the ſparckling iron entred vp to the top with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the tender fleſh: and the Cautery was drawen from the very eare, to the eie brow. In the doe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof: what paine the holy man ſuſtayned, he himſelfe expreſſed vnto his brethren, ſaying, Giue praiſe vnto God my brethren: for I verely ſay vnto you; that I haue neither felt the heat of the fire, nor yet any payne in my fleſh. And tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the Phiſitian, he ſaid vnto him, If the fleſh be not already well concocted, put in your iron againe. The Phiſitian, then perceaving, in ſo weake and feeble fleſh, ſo invincible a power of the ſpirit, admired with himſelfe thereat: and extolled this divine miracle, faying, I tell you plainly brethren: I haue ſeene wonderfull things to day. For the holy man was now come vnto that excellent degre of purity, that by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:13275:34"/>ſweet conſent &amp; harmonie, his flesh did agree with his ſpirit, &amp; his ſpirit did wholy conforme it ſelf vnto God, it was by a divine ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, brought to paſſe, that the creature obeying the Creator, was miraculouſly ſubiect to his will &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement. As may alſo be ſeene by this other exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mple of the ſame holy ſervant of God, who being ſicke one time of a moſt dangerouſe diſeaſe, in the Deſert of S. VRBANE; &amp; feeling then directly in himſelfe the defect of nature: demaunded a cup of wine to be brought vnto him:

By the taſte alſo whereof, he ſo ſpcedily recovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againe, that both the newneſſe of the raſt, &amp; the preſent reuewing of his imapired health: alter ring ſupernaturally, both the thing taſted, &amp; him that was the taſter therof, did by a double teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny confirme the abſolute diſpoiling of the olde man, and the perfect putting one of the newe.</p>
               <p>And not only was this manner of obedience, by the creatutes of God, to his holy ſervant, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited: but the providence alſo of the Creator, did every where condiſcend to ſatisfie his wil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. For his body being vpon a time ouer-dulled with the concurrence of many diſeaſes together,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:13275:34"/>he founde in himſelfe a deſire to heare ſome har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monicall kinde of ſounde, that thereby he might be reviued and receiue more comforte of ſpirite: but it not beſeming his life and profeſſion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it by the miniſterie of man, behold; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Angels, was ready to accompliſh, the Holy mans deſire. For as he was waking one night &amp; meditating vpon God, ſo dainly there ſounded a Harpe, of moſt wonderfull harmony, and of moſt ſweet and pleaſant melodie. At what time, he ſaw not any man: but might well perceive the paſſage and returne of the Harper, by the alteration of the ſounde of the muſicke; as it was ſometime nigher, and ſometime further from him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, directing his ſpirit vp to God, he was ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly delighted in that moſt ſweet ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, that he did almoſt thinke himſelfe, to haue bin in another world. This alſo could not be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from his brethren: who did oftentims by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vnfallible tokens perceiue, that he was viſited by Almightie God with ſo exceſſiue &amp; fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent conſolations, that it was not poſſible for him, in any ſorte to conceale them.</p>
               <p>An other time alſo, as the man of God went to preaeh, betweene <hi>Lombardie</hi> and the Marquiſate of <hi>Terviſium,</hi> being then accompained with one of his brethren, &amp; travailing along by the Riuer <hi>Poe,</hi> the darkeneſſe of the night ſodainly came vpon them. By meane whereof, the way being ſubiect vnto many and ſundry perilouſe daungers, as wel in regarde of the Fenns thereabouts: as alſo of the River it ſelfe, the brother aſſociate, ſpake vnto
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:13275:35"/>the holy man. ſaying: make thy praiers, good Father, vnto God, that we may be delivered out of theſe imminent daungers. To whom the man of God anſweared with much hope an confidence, in this wiſe: God is able no doubt (my brotherr if it ſtand with the good pleaſure of his ſweet diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſpearſe the deepe darkeneſſe of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure night, and to vouchſafe vnto vs the benefit of light. Which wordes he had no ſooner vtteted, but by the power of God, ſuch an aboundant light beganne to ſhine about them, that the night being darke to others, they nevertheleſſe did ſee in cleare and perfect light, not only the way, but very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things on every ſide aboute them, being by the conduct thereof, both corporally directed, &amp; ſpiritually, comforted: whereby they came ſafe the laſt to the place of their lodging, by the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of no ſmall ſpace of grounde, which they ioyfully overpaſſed, with ſinging Himnes and praiſes, in honor of Almightie God. See now &amp; conſider, vnto how great vertue and wounderful purity this holy man had attained; at whoſe beck, the fire did temper his heat, the water did change her taſt, the melodie of Angels did recreate his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, &amp; whome the light of heaven, did guide &amp; conduct in his way: that ſo it may fully appeare: that vnto the ſanctified ſences of Gods holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the whole frame of the world, did readilie yeild, an obſequious kinde of obeiſance.</p>

               <p>THE guardian and ornament of all vertues, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, had in ſo aboundant manner reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, this holy ſervant or God, that in his own reputation he was nothing els but a wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: whereas in very deed he was a perfect mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and amoſt gloriouſe reſſemblance of all ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of holyneſſe. Vpon this grounde worke, he determined to build vp himſelfe, having as a wiſe Architecke laid that very ſame foundation, which he had learnd of our Sauiour Chriſt. For this cauſe he ſaied that the ſonne of God, did come downe from the highnes of his Fathers Boſome to theſe our contemptible things, that being our Lord &amp; Maiſter, he might aſwell by his owne example, as by his worde: teach this excellent vertue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility vnto vs. And therefore, as the true diſciple of Chriſte, his praier was to ſeeme vile and baſe, both in his owne and other mens eies: reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring the ſame which is ſaid, by the moſt ſuperexcellent Maiſter, <hi>That which is high amonge men is abhomination with God.</hi> Thervnto alſo adding this ſaying of his owne, that: <hi>Looke how much a man is the ſight of God, ſo much he is, and no more.</hi> And therefore he held it for a very vaine and fooliſh thing, to be extolled with the favours of the world: reioycing much to be reproached, and ſorrowing no leſſe to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended. For he had farre rather heare himſelfe reuiled and reproched, than praiſed: or commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, knowing that the one might provoke him to amende, and the other might giue occaſion to fall. And for that cauſe, oftentimes, when the people extolled in him, the meritt of holineſſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:13275:36"/>one of his brethren, to vtter ſome words of debaſement and reviling againſt him, in his owne hearing. Which when the brother did, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much againſt his will, calling him a ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and rude body, an vnskilfull and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hireling: he was marveilouſly exhilerated ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, aſwell in minde, as in countinance: whereby he anſwered; Our Lord bleſſe thee, my moſt dere ſonne; for thou ſpeakeſt the very truth, and ſuch wordes, as it beſt beſeemeth <hi>Peter Bernardus</hi> ſonne, to heare.</p>
               <p>But to the end he might make himſelfe abiect and contemptible vnto others, he ſpared not his owne diſgrace, but in his publique praaching be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the people he would open and manifeſt his owne defects. As having once vpon occaſion of a right grievouſe ſickneſſe, remitted in ſome forte, the rigour of his vſuall abſtinence, for the better recoverie of his health againe, after ſuch time as he had ſomewhat better reſumed his ſtrength vnto him: the true diſpiſer of himſelfe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimating himſelfe to the reproache of his owne flesh; It is not meete, ſaid hee that I shoulde be held for a man of abſtinence, meane while that I ſecretly giue me ſelfe, to the pampering of my flesh. Wherefore he raiſed vp himſelfe, as being wholy inflamed with the ſpirit of holy humility &amp; aſſembling the people together, in a ſtreete of the City of <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> himſelfe with many of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, which he had brought with him, entred ſolemnely into the greater Church where having a roape faſtened about his neck, he cauſed himſelf
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:13275:36"/>to be drawen all naked ſaving only of his breeches in the open ſight, and veiwe of them all, even to that very ſtone whervpon malefactors at the time of their punniſhment, were wonte to be placed. Vpon the which, he then getting vp as he coulde albeit that, he were both weake and affected with a quartane Ague; yet in ſuch extreame cold as the time did then affoarde, did preach with great effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie and force of minde. At which time he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the hearing of them all, that he was in no wiſe to be honored as a ſpirituall man, but rather to be contemned of all men as a fleſhly and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenouſe perſonne. Wherevpon the people there aſſembled, wondring at ſo ſtrainge a ſpectacle: and being alſo compu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cted with devotion: becauſe they well knew the ſtrictneſſe of his auſterity, did openly proteſt, that ſuch manner of humility, was rather to be admired, than in any ſorte to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tared. And though this action might rather ſeeme to be a wonder in nature, according to the ſaying of the Prophet, then otherwiſe a matter of exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet was it vndoubtedly, a true patterne of perfect humility, whereby the ſcholler of Chriſt, is inſtructed to contemne the glory of tranſitorie praiſe, to repreſſe the ſwelling pride of arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and to reproue the falſhood of craftie diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lation, Oftentimes he did many things after this manner: that externally he might appeare as a loſt veſſel: and internally might poſſeſſe the ſpiritt of ſanctification.</p>
               <p>He ſtuddied alſo to hide the guifte of his Lord and Creatour in the ſecret incloſure of his breſſ
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:13275:37"/>thinking it not convenient to lay open to vaine glory, that which might be vnto himſelfe, an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ruine. For oftentimes being commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the multitudes, for a bleſſed and holy man he vſed to applie this manner of ſpeache vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſofte; I may yet haue both ſonnes and daughters doe not therefore praiſe, ſuch an one as is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſecure. <hi>No man is to be praiſed; whoſe ende is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine.</hi>

But to himſelfe he ſpake in this ſorte; Oh FRANCIS, if God Almighty had beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed ſo greate benefits, euen vpon a Thiefe, as he hath vouchſafed vnto thee; he would be no doubt more thankefull than thy ſelfe, vnto him, To his brethren alſo he ſaied oftentimes; thad no man ought with an vndue applauſe to flatter himſelfe vppon occaſion of any kinde of thinghe, which is in à ſinners power to doe. For ſaith he a ſinner may faſt, a ſinner may pray, a ſinner may mourne, and lament, a ſinner may alſo macerate his owne flesh: but this only a ſinner cannot do, namely to be faithfull, to his Lord and Maiſter. In this ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may haue iuſt cauſe to glory, if to our Lord we render, the glory which is of righte his owne: if ſerving him faithfully, whatſoever it is that he do giue vnto vs; the ſame do we faithfully reſctibe vnto him againe.</p>
               <p>But this Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gelicall Marcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, to the end he might by more occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in creaſe his gaine, &amp; might turn all the preſent time, to his furthermerit: tooke not much delight to hold the place of a Governour, as of a ſubiect: neither yet deſired ſo much to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,

<note place="margin">Behold the great obedience and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</note> And therfore reſigning his office of General, he deſired a gardia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whoſe wil &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement he mighte in all manner of pointes, accomodate himſelfe.

Wherefore his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome was, vnto ſuch brothers, as he vſually went with all, evermore to promiſe obedience, and faithfully to obſerue the ſame.

For the ſubiect (ſaieth he) muſt not conſider his Superiour as a man, but as him for whoſe lone he is become ſubiect vnto him. And by how much the more contemptible he is that doth commaund by ſo much the more acceptable, is the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of him, that doth exerciſe obedience.</p>
               <p>He being one ti<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded who was to be iudged truly obedient propoſed the ſimilitude of a deade body for an example. Take me vp (ſaith he) a dead body, &amp; put it where you pleaſe: you ſhal neither ſee it ſtriue, when it is moued; nor murmure, when it is placed, nor yet repine, when it is diſpla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But if you ſet it in a chaire, it looketh not vp
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:13275:38"/>alofte, but downe righte to the grounde: if you apparel it in purple roabes it diſcovereth the pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his countenance, two for one, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than it did before. Euen very this (ſaieth he) is a true patterne of obedience, who doth not diſcern why hee is mooued, who careth not where he is placed, who deſireth not to be changed, who being aduanced to office, retaineth his former humilitie: and who the more he is honored, doth ſo much the more repute himſelfe vnworthy. And for mine owne parte (quoth he one time) vnto his companions, I cannot thinke my ſelfe worthy the name of a Friar Minor, vnleſſe that I be in this very ſtate, which I ſhal now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe vnto you. See now, I goe as Prelate and Cheife of my brethren, conducting them all vnto the Chapter: there I preache among them, there I vſe mine admonitions vnto them, and in fine it is ſpoken with diſgrace vnto me.

If you will haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bring forth fruit in the Church of God: then hold and conſerue them, in the ſtate

               <p>And for ſo much as he preferred humility, as well in himſelfe, as in them that were vnder him, before all other honours beſides; God therefore the lover of humble perſons, adiudged him to be worthy in that reſpect of farre greater and more high dignities: accordingly as it was by a viſion from heaven revealed vnto one of the brethren, of ſpetiall vertue and devotion. For being in the company of the man of God, &amp; togeather with him praying in a certaint ſolitary &amp; aba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>doned Church, with a great &amp; fervent affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he fell into a tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and ſawe among many ſeates in heaven, one of more excellent dignity than all the reſt beſides: the ſame being adorned with precious ſtones, and ſhining alſo with all manner of glory. And won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering then within himſelfe, at the brightneſſe of that highe and eminent Throne, he beganne very carefully in his thoughts to enquire, who ſhould be ſo happy, as to be aſſumed therevnto. At which very time he hearde a voice which ſaied vnto him; This was the ſeate of one of them that fell, and now it is kept for humble <hi>Francis,</hi> And afterwards, the brother returning vnto himſelfe againe, followed the bleſſed ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the Church according to his wounted manner. At what time, talking, by the way as they went, of Almightie God: the brother, not vnmindefull of the viſion ſhewen vnto him, very prudently demaunded of him, what conceite and opinion he held of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. To whom the humble ſervant of Chriſt made
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13275:39"/>anſweare: Verily I doe eſteeme my ſelfe the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſinner of the world. Wherevnto the brother repliyng that he could not with the ſafety of his conſcience either ſay or thinke in ſuch wiſe of himſelf, he preſently therevnto againe reioined, ſaying: O my brother, if Chriſte had ſhewed ſo greate mercy vnto the moſt wicked man aliue, as he hath donne to me I do verely belieue that he would haue binne more thankefull vnto Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God than, I haue bin. Vpon the hearing of the which ſo admirable humility: the brother was abſolutely confirmed, concerning the truth of the viſion diſcloſed vnto him: acknowledging by teſtification of the holy Goſpell it ſelf, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the excellency of glory, from the which the proude is caſt downe: he that is truly humble is exalted.</p>
               <p>Another time alſo as he was praiyng in a certaine ſolitary Church within the Province of <hi>Maſsa,</hi> at the hill <hi>Caſalis;</hi> he vnderſtood by revelation of the ſpirit, that there were certain holy Reliques remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning there in that place: which he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with griefe of minde perceaving, to haue binne for long to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather defrauded, of the honor due vnto them; commanded his brethren to tranſlate them in all reverent manner, vnto a more convenient and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely place of abiding. But himſelfe being vppon iuſt occaſion for a time departed from them; the children then vnmindfull of the commandement of their father, neglected the merite of holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Notwithſtanding vpon a certaine day, when as they intended to celebrate the holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:13275:40"/>having removed the vpper covering of the Aultat, they founde there not without great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, ſundrie moſt faire and fragrant bones, diſcerning them to be the ſame holy Reliques, which no hand of man but the power of God had brought to the place. And it was no long while after,
<note place="margin">Thou which doſt contemne the relick of ſaintes, beholde what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the man of God gaue vnto them</note> that the holy man of God returning back againe: beganne diligently to enquire whither that which himſelfe had commaunded concerning the Reliques, had binne by them accompliſhed. But the brethren humbly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſing their fault, in neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting their due obedience, deſerved to obteine pardon, togeather with ſome punniſhement alſo therewithall. And then the holy man burſt forth into theſe wordes, Bleſſed, ſaith he, be my Lord my God, who hath by himſelf fulfilled that which your parte and dutie ought to haue performed. Conſider now diligently the cate of Gods divine providence, concerning this duſt of ours: &amp; pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der alſo maturely in minde the excellent ſavour which humble Saint <hi>Francis</hi> enioied in the eyes of God. For man refuſing to obay his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, Almighty God vouchſafed, to grant his deſires.</p>
               <p>Vpon a certaine time alſo comming to the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of IMOLA, he went forthwith to the Biſhop and humbly then beſought him that he might with his good favour, aſſemble the people vnto a Sermon. Whervpon the Biſhop ſomewhat rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repliyng, ſaied, It ſufficeth Brother that to the people vnder my charge, I my ſelf do preache, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the paterne of true humility, bowing
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:13275:40"/>downe his heade with humble reverence, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the place: how be it that within leſſe than an howre he returned thervnto againe. Wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the Biſhop ſeming to be much offended, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded of him what he ſought for at his handes, now the ſecond time: vnto whome with no leſſe inward humility of harte, than outward ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of words, thus the holy man replied: my Lord, if the Father, repell his ſonne at one doore, he muſt enter in againe at another. By force of which humility, the Biſhop being wholy ſubdued, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him with a loving and chearefull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: ſaiyng then vnto him:
<note place="margin">Beholde that none can preach the worde of god without leaue of his ſuperiour.</note> From hence forth both you and your brethren may freely preache in in my Dioceſſe, by my licence generall, for ſo much your holy humility, hath very well deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
               <p>It happened that once he came to <hi>Aretium</hi> at ſuch time as the whole Cittie was ſo miſerably af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with civill warre and diſſention, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be therby in preſent danger of vtter diſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.

But to the ende he might driue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way thoſe ſeditious powers of the aire, he ſent brother <hi>Silueſter,</hi> a man of ſingular ſimplicity, and ſincerity, aſſigning vnto him the Office of a Crier, ſaiyng: Go before the gate of the Citty, and on the parte of Almighty God commande the Diuells by vertue of obedience, that they ſpeedily departe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:13275:41"/>Incontinently the childe of true obedience made haſt to performe the Fathers commaundement: &amp; having firſt given praiſe vnto Almighty God, he beganne with loude voice to crie before the gate of the Citty, on the parte of God Almighty, and by the commaundement of his ſervant <hi>Francis,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ye farre, away from hence all ye wicked Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vells. Aud preſently vpon theſe wordes, the Citty returned vnto peace againe: and all the Cittizens with great good agreement, renewed the lawes of their former civility. For the raging pride of the Diuells, which had as it were beſieged that Citty, being once repelled, the wiſedome of the poore, that is to ſay, the humility of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then vppon them, reſtored peace vnto the people, and preſerved the Citty from deſolation. For by the merite of that rare and excellent vertue of humble obedience, he had obtained ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a commaundement ouer thoſe prowde &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſpirits, that the did both repreſſe theire inſolent arrogancy, and did alſo repell their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate violence. In this manner the prowde Diuels do ever flie away, from the eminent vertues of the humble: ſaving that ſometimes the mercie of God permitteth them to be buffeted of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie, for the better preſervation of their humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, according as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle writeth of himſelfe,

For being requeſted by Lord LEO, <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> of the Holy Croſſe to remaine ſome litle wile with him in the Citry, he humbly conſented ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, for the reverence and loue he bare vnto him.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13275:41"/>But in the very firſt night of his entertainement his praiers being ended, and he preparing himſelf to ſleep, a ſorte of Divells iſſued in vpon him, fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly aſſailing the ſouldier of Chriſte.

But as ſoone as the fiends were gone the ſervant of God calling his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, related vnto him the whole matter as it had befallen him: ſaiyng, I do verely belieue Brother that the Divells, who can doe nothing, but as the providence of God doth diſpoſe, haue for this cauſe ruſhed now with ſo great fury vpon me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ther is no good hope to be conceiued of my aboade in the Court of Princes. For my brethren that abide in poore and forlorne places, hearing that I am now in company with <hi>Cardinals,</hi> will peradventure imagine, that I am buſied in word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affaires, that I am advanced with honors, and that I do abound with pleaſures. Wherfore I thinke it better, that he who is given as an examplevn to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould avoide the Court, and converſe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly among the humble in humble places: to the ende that vnto them who ſuſtaine povertie, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe may giue encouragement, by ſuſtaining the like with them. In the morning therefore they came, and humbly excuſing themſelves, tooke their leaue of the <hi>Cardinall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the holy man abhorred pride, as the roote and of ſpring of all other evills beſides, no leſſe deteſting the foule vice of diſobedience, which he eſteemed as her moſt peſtilent &amp; deformed daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? but the humility of pennance, he did as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:13275:42"/>approue. It fortuned once, a certaine bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be brought before him, who having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome offence againſt the law of obedience, was therefore rightfully to be corrected, by the diſcipline of iuſtice. But the man of God, by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent tokens perceyving, that the brother was vn fainedly pennitent, for his fault of transgreſſion: was by the loue he bare to humility, much incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to pardone him yet leaſt that his facility in par doning might be vnto others an occaſion, in like manner to offend, he commaunded the brothers Capouche to be taken from him, and caſt into the middeſt of the flaming fire, to the end that all men might obſerue with how great and with what mauner of revenge, the offence of diſobedience ought of right to be chaſticed and corrected. But when the Caponche had bine a good while in the fire, he commaunded the ſame to be taken out of the fire againe, and to be delivered vnto the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vpon his humble repentance. A wonderfull marter it is to reparte. The Capouche being raked out from the middeſt of the flames, bare no marke or ſigne of burning at all: and ſo it came to paſſe, that wod, by this one miracle, did both approue the vertue of the holy man, and did alſo commend the humility of pennance. Worthely therefore is the humility of Saint FRANCIS to be immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and embraced, which obtained even in earth ſo admirable a dignity, as to incline the wil of God to his deſire, to chaunge the affection of man: to foile by his commaundement, the inſolent pride of the Divells, and with a beck to repreſſe, the

For being demanded of his brethren in the Chapter houſe, by what vertue a man might be made moſt grarefull and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vnto Chriſt; opening as it were the ſecretre of his harte, he made anſwere vnto them <hi>Knowe ye my brethren, that pouertie is the ſpeciall way of ſalvation,</hi> as being the nutriment of humility: and the roote of perfection; whoſe fruit is manifold but ſecrette and vnknowen.

               <p>And for becauſe in the asking of Almes, he was not ledde with deſire of gaine, but with the liberty and freedome of ſpirit; God therefore, the Father of the poore, ſee med ouer him to beare a ſpeciall care and protection. For it happened that the ſervant of God being ſurpriſed with ſickneſſe in a certaine place called <hi>Noceria,</hi> he was from thence convaied towards <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> by certaine ſolemne Meſſengers which the people of that Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had out of their great devotion, ſent for that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:13275:47"/>purpoſe vnto him. Who bringing with them the ſervant of Chriſt, came to a certaine poore village called <hi>Sarthianum,</hi> where as well the time of the day, as hungar alſo, requiring meate they went out to provide, but finding no meate to be bought for money, they returned emptie to the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. To whom the holy man ſaid: for this cauſe ye haue founde nothing, becauſe you truſt more in your Flies: than you doe in our Lord. For he called their pieces of mony, by the name of Flies. But returne (ſaid he) to the houſes, wherby you paſſed before, and humbly deſire the Almes of the inhabitants, offering the loue of God for a reward vnto them. Neither do ye out of a falſe eſtimation hereof conceiue, as of a thing either of baſhfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or baſenes for you to vndertake: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that the great Almes giver hath now after ſinne, by his aboundant goodneſſe, graunted &amp; diſpoſed of all thinges in Almes, both to the wot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy &amp; vnworthy. Wherevpon his conductours being warfairing men, ſetting ſhame a ſide, and craving Almes with a willing minde, made better market for the loue of God, than for their mony. For by the divine in ſtinct of God, the poore inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants were ſo compunct in heart, that they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered not only their goodes, but themſelues alſo therewithall. And ſo it came to paſſe, that the ſame degree of wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which mony could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue, euen that did the riche poverty of Sainct FRANCIS aboundantly ſupply.</p>
               <p>At ſuch time as the holy man lay ſick in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage nigh to <hi>Reate,</hi> a certaine Phiſitian reforted
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:13275:48"/>oftentimes with timely endeavour ynto him. But the ſervant of Chriſt not being able to giue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnto him anſwereable to his paines and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: the moſt liberall God, who would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe him without a preſent requitall, recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his godly induſtrie in his poore ſervants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, with this newe and vnvſuall benefite. For this Phifition having about that very time newly built him a houſe wherevpon he had beſtowed, the whole ſumme of all his former gaines, and labours, the ſame by meane of a wide rifte in the wall, reaching from the toppe to the bottome of the foundation, was ready to fall to the grounde. in ſo much as it ſeemed impoſſible by any art or numane induſtrie to be prevented. But he having great confidence in the meritts of the holy man, did with great zeale of faith requeſt the brethren, that ſome thing might be given vnto him, which the man of God had toucht with his handes. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving therefore at length with great inſtancy of intreatie obtained, ſome litle parcell of his haire, he put the ſame over night within the rift of the wall, which he riſing betimes in the morning, founde to be ſhut and conioined againe with ſo ſtrong &amp; firme a ſolidity, that neither could he pul out the Reliques which he had incloſed therein, nor yet could he finde any marke of the former diviſion. Whereby it was through the goodneſſe of God provided that he who diligently miniſtred vnto the decaied body of the holy ſervant of God did prevent the danger of his own dwelling houſe which was ready to fall to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:13275:48"/>
               <p>Another time alſo the man of God deſiring to go vnto a certaine deſert, where he might more freely attend vnto contemplation: for ſo much as he was weake and feeble he was carried vppon a certaine poore mans Aſſe. And when as the ſame poore man by reaſon of following the ſervant of Chriſt, and paſſing with him over the mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſe places, in the extreameſt heats of the yeare, was then ſo wearried with the painfullnes and length of his iourney, that he ſeemed to fainte through the exceſliue heat of his thirſt, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beganne to crie after the holy man; Beholde I die for thirſt, vnleſſe I may be preſently refreſhed by the benefit of ſome draught of drinke. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vppon the man of God, incontinently alighting downe from the Aſſe, fixed his knees vppon the grounde,
<note place="margin">Praying vpon his knees and lifting his handes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvardes heauen he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> and ſtreetching forth his armes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ceaſed not to pray vntill he perceived himſelf to be heard. But his praier being ended at le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, make haſte (ſaith he) vnto the man, and goe to yonder rocke, for there thou ſhalt finde a ſpring of liuely water, which Chriſt hath mercifully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided out of the ſtone, for thee to drinke. Woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull without doubt is the favourable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Almighty God, which doeth ſo eaſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it ſelfe vnto his ſervants deſires. The Thirſtie man drank from out of the rock, of that comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and refreſhing water, which was by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of praier produced, and filled his cuppe, out of the moſt hard and flintie ſtone.

               <p>But in what wonderfull manner Chriſt did by the merites of his poore ſervant, multiplie the meate in the Sea, conſidering that we are hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſet it downe in place convenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, thus much only it ſhall be ſufficient in this place to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed,

And allbeit that our of this pietie he were devoutly affected vnto all thinges: yet at ſuch time eſpecially, as he percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that the ſoules which were redemed with the precious bloud of Chriſte Ieſus, were defiled with any filth of ſinne, he then bewailed them, with ſuch a tenderneſſe of commiſeration, that as a mother in Chriſte, he dailie laboured to bring them forth againe. And this was the ſpecial, cauſe that moved him ſo much to reuerence the miniſters of the word of God: for that they doe both raiſe vpp ſeede to theire brother deceaſed namely vnto Chriſt, who vouchſafed to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ſinners) by working the converſion of them; and being converted, doe alſo governe
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:13275:50"/>them, with an induſtriouſe &amp; careful pietie. This excellent office of commiſeration, he affirmed to be vnto the Father of mercie more acceptable than any ſacrifice: eſpecially when it proceedeth from the induſtrie of perfect charitie: whereby more diligent labour is emploied therein by force of example, than by courſe of words, by mourne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful praiers, rather than by babling diſcourſes.

Before ſuch an one therefore, he ſaied, that a ſimple and ignorant brother was far away to be preferred, who by his owne good example,
<note place="margin">1. <hi>Reg.</hi> 2 5.</note> prouoketh others alſo vnto the like. And to his effect he expounded that place of holy ſcripture; <hi>Vntil the barren haue brought forth many children.</hi> For the barren (ſaied he) is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be that poore brother, whoſe proper office, is not to ingender children in the holy Church.

And <hi>She that hath many children, shal be enfeebled:</hi> becauſe the vaine and talking preacher who now glorieth of many children, as by meane of his owne labour and induſtrie begotten, ſhal the plainely knowe and diſcerne himſelfe not to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13275:50"/>haue any right or intereſt in them at all. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with all the hartie affection and deſires of pietie, and with a burning and zealous emulation of minde, thirſting after the ſalvation and good of ſoules, was euer more accuſtomed to ſay, that he was as it were replenished with ſweete odours and was in a maner annointed with a moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſe and delightfull ointmente, ſo often as he hearde that many weare induced vnto the way of truth, by the ſweete ſmelling fame of his holy bretheren, diſperſed through ſundrie partes of the world. Vpon the hearing of theſe reports his ſpirit not a litle reioyced: heaping moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and aboundant blesſings, vp on all thoſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, who either by worde or deede, did induce ſinners vnto the lout of Chriſt. But he contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwiſe, whoſoever, did by theire euel demeanoure violate the holy ſtare of Religion? did thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre the moſt greivouſe ſentence of his maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Of thee, O my moſt holy Lord (ſaid he) and of all thy bleſſed courte of heauen, and of me thy poore and humble ſervant, be the al aceurſed, who by theire euill example, doe confoundeand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy that which by the holy bretheren of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, thou haſt already builded, and doeſt not ceaſe yet to build.

But onetime eſpecially being marveilouſe much diſtreſſed with the evill

Why arte thou thus, thou poore and ſillie man afflicted? haue I in ſuch maner of wiſe ordained thee to be Paſtor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this my religious order, that thou doeſt not knowe me to be the principall patrone and dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor thereof?

It is I who haue called them, I alſo will keepe them and feede them; and if ſome of them doe at any time falle away, I will ſubrogate other into theire roomes againe: ſo farre forth that if they be not yet borne, I wil make them to be borne vpon purpoſe.

               <p>The vice of detraction alſo, he abhorred, as the profeſſed enemie to the pure fountaine of grace and pietie, as the venemovſe ſting of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and as a moſt deſperate and deadly poyſon, avowing the ſame to be moſt abhominable, in the ſight of Gods moſt mercifull and ſweete diſpoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: conſidering that the man of detraction is fed with the bloud of ſoules, which he doth murder with the fowrde of his tongue. And hearing once one of the bretheren to diſgrace the good name and fame of another, he turned therewithall vnto
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13275:51"/>his Vicar, ſaying: ariſe, ariſe, diſcuſſe the matter diligently: and if you ſhal finde the brother accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be innocent faile not with sharpe corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to chaſtice the accuſer, wherby to make him an example in that behalfe vnto others. And ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie times alſo he would aiudge that brother who had diſpoiled another of his good name and fame, to be himſelfe deprived of his habite: and that he might not preſume to lifte vp his cies vnto our Lord, before he had done his beſt indevour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that which he had vncharitably taken away, For ſo much greater ſaid he is the impiety of detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, than of open theiues and robbers, as the law of Chriſt which is fulfilled in the obſervanc of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doth more preciſely oblige vs to deſire the well fare of our neighbours ſoules, than of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
               <p>And with a wonderfull tenderneſſe of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, commiſerating the cauſe of all that were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with any corporall grief or moleſtation, if he ſaw any penurie or defect in any man, he did with a notable ſweetneſſe of a moſt zealous affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction induce him to relie vpon Chriſte, He had out of doubt, an ingrafted clemencie within him, which nevertheleſſe the ſuperinfuſed pietie of Chriſt, doubled yet more and more vppon him. His minde therefore was even melted towardes the poore and feeble, and vnto them whome he could not helpe with his hand, he reached fotth his moſt harty affection. It happened once that a certaine poore man. asking Almes with ſome importunity at the handes of one of the brethren,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13275:52"/>the ſame brother returned an ouer hard and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentle anſweare vnto him. Which being heard by this devout lover of the poore, he forth with commaunded the brother, to caſt himſelf downe naked, before the poore beggars feete, in ſuch wiſe acknowledging himſelf to be faulty, craving alſo the help of his praier, &amp; pardon for hisoffece. Vpon the humble performance whereof, the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving father ſweetely ſpake thus vnto him: When thou ſeeſt any poore creature, Omy brother, thou haſt a liuely reſemblance preſented vnto thee of our Lord, and of his poore Mother.

Whervppon it fell out, that he returning once from <hi>Sienna,</hi> did meete a poore man in the way: at what time himſelfe vpon occaſion of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall infirmitie, had a certaine kind of ſhort cloake which he did weare aboue his habite. But behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with a tender eye the miſery of that poore man, he ſpake vnto his companion, ſaieng: we ought verily brother to reſtore this cloake vnto this poore man, it being of right his owne: for we tooke the ſame but as lent vnto vt, vntill we
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13275:52"/>might chance to finde another in greater neede thereof than our ſelues, But the brother conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the neceſſity of the good father, did very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and ſtiffly therein withſt and him, in noe wiſe aſſenting that meanewhile he provided for others, himſelfe ſhould remaine diſappointed. Where vnto he thus replied, I hold it, ſaid he, for a matter of theft to be by the great Almes giver imputed vnto me, if this cloake, which I beare about me, I ſhall not giue vnto a more needy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone. And therefore, whenſoever any thing was given him to releiue the neceſſity of his body, he vſed to aske leaue of the giuers, that he might lawfully beſtowe the ſame, vpon ſome poorer body than himſelfe as he might happe to meete, He ſpared no manner of thing, neither cloakes, nor habbitts, nor bookes, nor ornaments alſo of the Aultar, but gaus them all to the poore as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion required, to performe the office of pietie. And oftentimes when as he mette with poore men laden vpon the way, he vndertooke theire burdens, vpon his owne weake and feeble ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
               <p>And conſidering with aboundanr piety the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of all things created, he called even the leaſt creatures by the name of Brother and Siſter: becauſe he knewe them to haue one and the ſame beginning with himſelfe. But yet vnto thoſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures aboue all others he did beare a moſt ſweete and entire affection, which the Scriptures do te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtefie by a naturall likeneſſe to repreſent the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenes of Chriſt. He oftentimes redeemed lambes.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13275:53"/>which were ledde to be killed: reſting mindefull of that moſl milde Lambe, who would be ledde to the ſlaughter for redemption of ſinners. It chaunced one time that the ſervant of God being lodged in the Monaſtery of Saint <hi>Verecundus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.7.</note> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhopricke of <hi>Eugubium</hi> a certaine Ewe brought forth a yong lambe that very night. But a feirce and ravening Sowe that came by, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of the poore innocent Lamb, did bite it to death with her cruell tuskes. Vpon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof the good father being moved with a marveillous compaſſion, and remembring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall the vnſpotted Lambe, lamented before the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all for the death of the Lambe, ſaieing: O woe is me, my brother Lambe, innocent creature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting Chriſt to the mindes of men, curſed be that wicked Sowe which hath killed thee, and let her not be meare for any, either man or beaſt: A marveilouſe thing it is to tell. Forthwith that brutefull Sowe beganne to be ſicke: and being punniſhed with three daies continuall paine in her body, ſuſtained at length the vengeance of death. But being afterwardes throwen into the vale of the monaſterie, and lieng there long time together ſhe grewe ſo hard and drie as a board, that ſhe was no meate for any hungar ſtarven creature. Let the impiety of man therefore well weigh and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with how great punniſhment it is finally to be rewarded, if the crueltie of a beaſt doe appeare to haue binne ſmeeten, with ſo terrible a kinde of death. And let the devout and faith full man, not leſſe ponder and weigh with himſelfe, of what
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13275:53"/>wonderfull vertue and ſweetneſſe, was the piety of the ſevant of God: conſidering that the nature of brute beaſts did in their kinde applaude &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelves vnto him. For making his ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney once neare to the Cittie of <hi>Sienna,</hi> he founde in the paſtures a great heard of ſheepe. Which when he had curteouſly ſaluted, according to his wonted manner, the ſheepe leaving their paſture, ranne all vnto him: and lifting vp their heads, did fixe their eies directly vpon him. So great an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe they verely made vnto him, that both the ſheppheards &amp; the brethren marveiled not a litle therat: beholding not only the lambes of the ſheep but alſo the Rammes themſelues leaping and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing in ſuch marveilous manner about him.</p>
               <p>Another time alſo at our Ladies of <hi>Portiuncula</hi> a certaine ſheepe was preſented vnto the man of God: who gratefully received the ſame for loue of that innocencie and ſimplicitie, which the nature thereof pretendeth. This ſhepe the devoute man admoniſhed, both to be attentiue vnto the praiſes of God, and alſo to be warie from all maner of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the bretheren. Wherevpon the ſheepe, marking, as it were, and obſerving, the pietie of the ſervant of God; did very carefully obſerue his rule and inſtruction. For hearing the bretheren to ſing in the Quire, shee alſo entred into the Church without any direction, bowing her knees and bleating, before the Altar of the Virgin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the moſt vnſported and innocente lambe; and that in ſuch maner of wiſe as if ſhe did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and reioyce to ſalute her. And yet moreover,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13275:54"/>when the moſt ſacred body of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">VVhen the moſt ſacred body of Chriſt vvas eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated in time of Maſse a sheepe did bowe her knees thereat. See how brut beaſts do know &amp; reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there god which miſerable beretickes refuſe to do.</note> was elevated amidſt the ſolemnities of the MASSE, ſhe alſo then did bend her knees: as if that ſhe poore reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent beaſt, accuſed the vndevoure of theire irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and invited the devoute ſervantes of Chriſt vnto a further adoration of this moſt holy Sacrament. And one time he chanced for reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of that moſt milde lambe of God, to haue in the cittie with him alitle lambe, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the cuſtodie of a noble Matrone, called <hi>Madame lacoba de ſeptem ſotiis,</hi> to be by her norished in her cloſette, but the lambe being inſtructed as it were by the Saints, in ſpirituall thinges, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies with inſeperable diligence attend vpon her, as ſhe wente to the Church, all the time ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained there, &amp; when she returned from thence. If it were long in the morning before she roſe, the lambe riſing vp, ſeemed to force her, as it were with his hornes, and with bleating voice to incite her, admonishing her aſwell by geſture as by ſignes, to make haſt to the Church. Wherfore this lambe the ſcholer of holy S. <hi>Francis,</hi> being now become a Maiſter of devotion, was by this noble woman kept, as worthy to be both loved and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Graecium,</hi> alſo vpon a time, a certaine yong leveret was given aliue, vnto the ſervant of God: which being ſet free vpon the ground, whereas it might haue gone which way it wonlde: yet being by the good father called vnto him, it came forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with running &amp; leaping into his boſome, making much of it therefore with great affection, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13275:54"/>to haue compaſſion thereof, as a mother hath towardes her childe: and warning, it with ſwete wordes, not againe: to let it ſelf be taken, gaue it free leaue to departe. But being put oftentimes vpon the ground, and returning alwaies into the fathers boſome againe, as if it had ſome ſecrete fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, of the inwarde pietie of his loving harte at length by the fathers commaundement it was brought by the bretheren, vnto ſome ſafer parts of the deſert. In like maner alſo, in the Ile of the Lake of <hi>Peruſium</hi> aliue cunnie was taken, and brought to the man of God: which though it thought to eſcape from all others beſides, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his handes and boſome it committed it ſelfe, with a domeſticall kinde of ſecuritie. So alſo as he paſſed once to the deſert of <hi>Graecium</hi> along by the Lake of <hi>Reate,</hi> a certain fiſherman, of ſpeciall devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion preſented a river foule vnto him: after grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full acceptaunce whereof, with opened handes he gaue it way to departe: though nevertheleſſe the foule remained with him, whervpon he lifte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vp his eies, remained long in praier, and retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a long hower after vnto himſelfe againe as it were from another world: he ſweetely the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d time commaunded the birde to departe and praiſe our Lord. After licence therefore with his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing receaved, and pretending alſo a certaine kind of ioye, as by the geſture of her body appeared, ſhe tooke her flight away. In the ſame lake alſo was brought vnto him a great ſiſhe aliue: which he ſaluting as his cuſtome was by the name of bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did forth with returne it againe into the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13275:55"/>neere to the ſheepe. But the fishe plaieng in the watter before the man of God, as being in a manner allured with his loue: would in no wiſe departe from the shippe, but vpon his licence &amp; benediction formerlie obtained.</p>
               <p>And yet alſo, another time, walkeng with one of the brethren, nigh vnto the Marshelandes of <hi>Venice,</hi> he found a great multitude of birdes, ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and ſinging in the Thicket. Vpon ſight whereof, he ſaied to his companions; Our Siſters the birdes doe praiſe their creatour: let vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore goe, into the middeſt among them, and there let vs ſing our praiſes, and Canonicall houers to our Lord. And being entred into the verv middeſt of them all, the birdes never ſtirred out of theire places: and for becauſe in reſpect of their chirping noiſe, the holy men and his brother could not heare one another in ſaieng their houres: he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turning himſelfe to the birdes, ſpake thus vnto them. ye birds, my ſiſters, leaue of your ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vntill we may haue performed the due praiſes we owe to God. The birdes preſently ſurceaſed all manner of noiſe: and continewed all that while in ſilence: vntill the ſaid houres and praiſes being leiſurely performed, they were licenſed by the Saint of God to ſing againe. But ſo ſoone as the man of God had giuen this licencevnto them, they preſently betooke themſelues to theire former ſinging.</p>
               <p>So alſo at <hi>s. Maria de Portiuneula,</hi> a certain Grashop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per fitting &amp; ſinging vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a figg tree, nigh vnto the Cell of this holy man, and having with her fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13275:55"/>voice, incited the Seruant of God to divine praiſes, who even in ſmall thinges had learnt to admire the magnificence of the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: he called her one day vnto him, at what time, ſhee, as being therevnto from heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed came flieng by and by vpon his hand. To whome when he had ſaid, Sing my ſiſter Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and with thy chirping voice, praiſe thy Lord and Creator, she obeieng, without any ſtay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſing, never ceaſing, vntill by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of the Father, ſhe flewe backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to her vſuall place of abiding. But there this Graſhopper remained eight daies together, day by day comming, ſinging, and departing, according to the Fathers commaundement. Wherevpon at length the man of God ſaied to his companions, Let vs now licence our Siſter Graſhopper to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: for ſhe hath now ſufficiently delighted vs with her ſinging, having for eight daies ſpace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtirred vp our mindes therewithall, to the praiſe of Almighty God. And preſently vppon leaue obtained, the Graſhopper depared from him not comming any more to that place, as in noe wife daring to transgreſſe his commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>As once he lay ſicke at <hi>Sienna,</hi> a certaine noble man ſent him a liue Pheaſent Cock, which had binne newly taken: this Cock had no ſoner ſeene and heard the holy man, but that he adheared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him with ſo great a lovingneſſe, that he would by no meanes ſuffer himſelfe to be diſioined from him. For being oftentimes put out of the brothers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13275:56"/>harbour, into a certaine vineyarde by, to the ende that if he would he might departe, he ſwiftely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies returned vnto the father againe: as if he had all his time bin by him brought vp and nourished. But being at length beſtowed vpon a certain man, who was accuſtomed out of devotion to viſite the ſervant of God; the pheaſant as if it had binne grievouſe vnto him to be abſented from the good Fathers ſight, refuſed to take any manner of meat. Whereas afterwardes being returned to the ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God, he eare his meate very greedily by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſture diſcovering his inward ioy.</p>
               <p>When he came to the deſert of <hi>Aluerna,</hi> to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Lent which he obſerved in honor of S. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel, divers ſortes of birdes came flieng about his Cell, who reioicing as it were at his comming, did with their pleaſant harmony and other tokens of mirth ſeeme to in vite and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure the devoute father to ſtay and abide with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which when he well perceaued, he ſaid to his companion: I ſee plainely brother it is the verie will of God that we ſhould now ſtay heere for a while, becauſe our Siſters the birdes doe ſeeme to be ſo much comforted at our preſence. And whiles he thereforefore remained in that place a faulcon there building her neſt: was ioined vnto him in a ſingular manner of frendſhippe. For with her ſinging and noiſe, ſhe did continually in the night time, prevent the hower whereat the holy man was accuſtomed to riſe, to his divine ſervice which was a thing moſt acceptable vnto the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God: for that the ſo great watchfullneſſe
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13275:56"/>of this faulcon ouer him, did cauſe him to ſhake of all ſloth and ſlugiſhenes. But when the ſervant of Chriſt was more than vſually afflicted with any kind of infirmitie, then did the faulcon in ſome ſorte abſtaine, neither did ſhee at thoſe times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake him ſo earely but as it were inſtructed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto of God; about the breake of day ſhe gaue a gentle knocke with the bell of her voice: &amp; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it ſeemeth, that this reioicing of birdes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kindes, and that the ſinging alſo of the faulco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be a divine foreſignification: that this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table praiſer and moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t worſhipper of God, being carried aloft by the wings of contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion should then be there exalted: by a Seraphicall apparition.</p>
               <p>During the time he once aboad in the Ermitage of <hi>Grecium:</hi> the inhabitans in that place, were grievouſly afflicted, with many and ſundry evills. For not only a multitude of ravening wolues did thereaboutes conſume both men and beaſts, but a yearely and violent Tempeſt alſo of haile, did continually deſtroy, the corne and vineyardes. At what time therefore as this denouncer of Gods holy Goſpell preached vnto them in the middeſt of this their diſtreſſe and affliction, he ſaied vnto them: to the honor and praiſe of Almighty God, I require you to be of good hope, that all this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilence ſhall ſoone forſake you, and that our Lord with his mercifull eies regarding you, will multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie you in temporall goodes, if crediting my wordes, you will nowe firſt of all beginne to take compaſſion vppon your ſelues: whereby ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13275:57"/>a true confeſſion of your ſinnes, you may bring forth the workes worthy of pennance. But this againe I denounce vnto you, that if as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greatefull men for ſuch benefits, you shall returne to your vomite againe: then shall your plague be renewed, your punnishment shalbe redoubled, and a greater indignation shall iuſtly fall vpon you From that very hower the people doeing penna<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce according as he exhorted them, their miſeries ceaſed, their daungers were all at an end: &amp; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the wolues nor the haile did any more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief among them. Nay which is more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, if the neighbours fieldes, were at any tyme endaungered with haile, ſo ſoone as it approached vnto theire confines, either there it reſted, or els diverted to ſome other parte. Thus not only the haile did ceaſe, but the wolues alſo kept the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venante of the ſervant of God, neither did they offer any more contrary to the law of piety to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage againſt men converted vnto God, ſo longe as they according to their promiſe, did not wickedly transgreſſe againſt the lawes of God Wherfore we haue good cauſe, devoutly to thinke of the piety of this bleſſed man: which was of ſo marveilouſe ſweeteneſſe and efficacy that it tamed wilde crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in ſo much that thoſe of the woodes it made liue in howſes, &amp; made double thrice thoſe which were of more gentle nature, it did incline the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of brute beaſtes which hath binne fince the fall of man rebellious againſt him, to become now obedient vnto him. This verely is that vertue which confederating all creatures with it ſelfe, <hi>Is
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13275:57"/>profitable to all thinges: having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that to come.</hi>

               <p>BVT that fervent Charitie, Wherewith this frend of the ſpouſe, Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inflamed, what man may be able ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to expreſſe? For as a certaine fierie coale, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be wholy abſorbted in the flame of Gods loue.

And therefore to offer ſuch manner of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buts inſteede of Allmes, he ſaied it was a noble kinde of prodigality: and thoſe that eſteemed thereof leſſe than of mony, he held to be moſt foolishe, confidering that the vnpriſable valewe of the only loue of God, is aboundantly ſufficient to gaine the Kingdome of heaven: and that the loue of him who loued vs much, is much to be loued and eſteemed. But to the end he might be out of all things provoked vnto the loue of God, he marveilouſly reioiced in all the workes of our Lord his handes: and by the mirrours of delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, he raiſed vp himſelf into the liuely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall and cauſe of them: For he did beholde in

For with an affection of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more than had binne heard of, he taſted in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the creatures as it were in litle Rivers, that excellent goodneſſe of the fountaine it ſelf; and as if he had conceaved a heauenly harmony, in the conſonantes of the vertues and actions giuen by God vnto them, he ſweetely exhorted them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the prophet DAVID, vnto the honour and praiſe of Almighty God.</p>
               <p>Chriſt Ieſus crucified evermore remained as a handefull of Mirrhe within the boſome of his minde into whome he deſired to be through the fervour of moſt exceſſiue loue in euery parte transformed.

               <p>This poore man of Chriſt had no more but two mites, his body namely and his ſoule, to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God with liberall charitie. But theſe two he ſpated not for the loue of Chriſt to offer vp ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that as it were all his life time, he ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his body, by the rigour of abſtinence. and his ſpirit by the fervour of deſire, exterioutly in the Porche of his body immolating the burnt ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and in the temple of his ſoule inwardly begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſweete ſmelling incenſe, of devotion. But yet for all this ſo was he borne alofte to divine things by the exceſſiue devotion of charity, that neuer theleſſe his affectuous benignity did dilate it ſelfe vnto his Copartners in nature and grace. For whome the ſingular pietie of his hart had made to be a brother vnto all creatures beſides him, it is no marvaile if the charity of Chriſt did make to be much more a brother vnto creatures ennobled with the Image of their creatour, and redeemed
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:13275:59"/>with the bloude of theire maker. And therefore he reputed not himſelfe to be the friend of Chriſt vnleſſe he did cheriſhe the ſoules, which he had redeemed. He ſaied that nothing was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the wellfare of ſoules, approvinge the ſame eſpecially by this, that the only begoten ſoone of God, vouchſafed for the loue of them to hang vpon the Croſſe. And from hence procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his combatte in praier, his diſcourſe in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and his exceſſe in giving good example. Wherevpon ſo often, as ouer much auſterity was reprehended in him, he made anſwere that he was giuen for an example vnto other men, For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that his innocent fleſh, which had now willingly and freely ſubiected it ſelfe to the ſpirit, ſtoode no waies in neede of any ſcourge at all, for his owne offences; yet for examples ſake he daily renewed both paines and burdens vppon himſelfe, keeping hard waies for other mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For he vſed to ſay, <hi>If I ſpeake with the tongues of men and of Angells and haue not Charity,</hi> in my ſelfe, whereby to giue example of vertue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my neighbours: I profite others but litle, and my ſelfe no white at all.</p>
               <p>And with a fervent inflammation of charitie, he did emulate the glorious triumphe of the holy Martirs: for that in them neither could the flame of loue, be extinguiſhed, nor yet could the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of fortitude, be any way infeebled. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being wholy ſet on fire, with that perfecte charity, which caſteth out feare, he alſo deſireth by the flame of Martirdome to offer himſelfe as a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13275:60"/>liuing ſacrifice vnto our Lord: to the end he might make requitall, according to his power. vnto Chriſt that ſuffered death for vs vpon the Croſſe, and might alſo provoke others by his example vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loue of God: For in the ſixt yeare after his converſion, burning altogether in deſire of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirdome, he purpoſed to paſſe the ſeas vnto the partes of <hi>Siria,</hi> to preach the Chriſtian faith and pennance, vnto the <hi>Saracens,</hi> and other infidelles, And being gotten aboarde into a cerraine ſhippe, that made for thoſe partes, by meane of contrary winds, he was inforced to put a ſhore vpon the coaſte of <hi>Salauonia.</hi> Where having made ſome tyme of aboade, and nor having founde any ſhippe in all that ſpace prepartd to paſſe the Seas: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by perceiving himſelfe to be diſappointed of his deſires, made earneſt requeſt vnto certaine Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, euen then prepared for <hi>Ancona,</hi> that for the loue of God they would take him along with them. But they obſtinately refuſing him, as not having wherewith to deftay his charges: the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of God ſingulerly repoſing vpon the goodneſſe of our Lord, entred ſecretly into the ſhippe, himſelf and his companion with him. At that time fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be there, a certaine man, of Gods owne ſending, as is to be thought, for the relief of his poore ſervant: who bringing with him neceſſary proviſion of victuals, and calling vnto him one of the ſhippe, that had the feare of God before him, delivered the ſame vnto him, ſaieng, keepe theſe things faithfully for the poore brethren, that lie ſecret in the ſhippe, and in the time of neede, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parte
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13275:60"/>thereof friendly vnto them. And ſo it came to paſſe that when the ſhippemen, labouring by ſorce of the windes for many daies together, and all that time not being able to get to lande, had in the meane while exſpended all their proviſions yet ſtill vnto poore Saint <hi>Francis</hi> remained, of that Almes which was by Gods appointement reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for him. Which nevertheieſſe, though it were but very ſmall, was yet by Gods devine power, ſo marveilouſely multiplied, that they making very many daies aboade vpon the Sea, it aboundantly ſupplied all their neceſſities euen vntill they came vnto the very Porte of <hi>Ancona.</hi> The marriners therefore perceiving themſelues by meane of the ſervant of God to haue eſcaped many daungers of death: as men who had ſeene the horrible daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the Sea. and had alſo well obſerved the wonderfull workes of our Lord in the deepe gaue thanks therfore vnto Almighty God: who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe alwaies in his friends and ſervants to be marveilouſe, and worthy to be beloued.

               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe for ſo much as the fruit of Martirdome had ſo farre forth allured his harte, that aboue all the merites of vertues he longed to ſuffer a preciouſe death for Chriſt, he tooke his way towardes <hi>Morocco,</hi> there to preache the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell of Chriſt vnto <hi>Miramolin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:13275:61"/>by any meanes he might attaine vnto the deſired crowne of Martirdome. For he was borne along with ſo fervent a deſire therof, that albeit he were very weake of body, he did nevertheleſſe outgoe his companion, in travell, and being full of ſpeede to bring his purpoſe to effect, did flie away, as it were, for very drunckeneſſe &amp; fervour of ſpirite. But being now already comme into <hi>Spaine,</hi> by Gods ſweete diſpoſition which reſerved him for other things, there came vpon him a moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous infirmitie, whereby he was ſo hindered that he could in no wiſe accompliſh what he ſo much deſired. The man of God therefore perceivinge that his life in the fleſh, was yet neceſſary for the yſſue which he had begotten, albeit that he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med death as a gaine for himſelfe: therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to feede the ſheepe, which were by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, vnto his care, commended.</p>
               <p>But the burning fire of charity, more then infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his ſpirit vnto Martirdome, he yet the third time adventured, for ſpreading abroade the faith of the holy Trinity, to travell into the parts of the infideles. For in the thirtenth yeare after his converſion, haſtening towardes the partes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the <hi>Soldan</hi> had given out a cruell edict: that

But the hardie warriour of Chriſt Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> hoping that now ſhortly his purpoſe might be obtained, determined to vndertake the iourny being nothing terrefied with the feare of deathe, but much provoked with the deſire thereof.

But the ſervant of Chriſt enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with Gods divine Oracle, if thou wilt, ſaid he: with thy people be converted vnto Chriſte: I will for his loue willingly remayne amonge you, But if you make doubt for the faith of Chriſte, to refuſe the law of Mahomet, commaunde then a very great fire to be kindled, and I together with thy Prieſts will enter into the ſame; that yet ſo at leaſt thou maieſt well diſcerne, Which faith is of very right to be held, for more holy and certaine.

Then ſaid the holy man vnto him, If thou wilt for thy ſelf &amp; thy people make promiſe vnto me, tocome to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chriſt, if I ſhal without harm paſſe through the fire: I wil enter, into the ſame my ſelf alone: &amp; if I ſhalbe burnt, be it imputed to my ſins, but if the mighty power of God ſhal protect me, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg then Chriſt the power &amp; wiſdome of God to be himſelf very God, &amp; vndoubted Lord &amp; ſaviour of al ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kind. But the <hi>Solda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> anſwered, that he durſt not accept of this conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for that he feared a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> among the people. Nevertheleſſe they offered vnto him many pretious rewards al which the man of God, being no waies covetous of wordly things, but altogeather deſirouſe of the ſaluation of ſouls, did vtterly reiecte as durt. Whereby the Souldan perceiving the holy man to be ſo perfect a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wordly things: &amp; being alſo moved with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration therof, conceyved in himſelf a far greater devotion towards him. And albeit that he would not, or that perhaps he durſt not receiue the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, yet did he inſtantly beſeeche the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt to accept of the forſaide guifts to be for his ſoules health beſtowed vpon Chriſtian poore people or to the vſe of their Churches. But he for that he eſche wed the burden of mony, and did not ſee the rote of true piety to be in the mind
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:13275:63"/>of the Souldan, would in no wiſe be perſwaded there vnto. And furthermore perceiving that he did not prevaile in the converfion of that nation neither yet could attaine vnto his purpoſe therein vpon forewarning by revelation from heaven re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, he made his returne vnto the partes of the faithfull. And ſo both mercifully and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilouſly it came to paſſe, by the clemencie of God ſoe ordaining. and by the vertue of the holy man promerriting the ſame, that this friende of Chriſt did for his loue ſeeke after deathe with all his whole deſire, and could by no meanes find it: whereby he might nor want the metrite of moſt deſired Martirdome, but might be yet reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to be afterwardes inſigned with a ſinguler priviledge. And by that meanes was it alſo effected, that, that divine fire did yet more perfectly eſcape and boile in his harte, that after wardes it might more powerfully, flame and burſt out in his flesh O holy man, moſt truly bleſſed: whoſe fleſh al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not cut with the ſworde of the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant doth not yet wante the ſimilitude of the Lambe that was ſlaine, O truly and perfectly bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (I ſay, whoſe life although the ſworde of the perſecutor did not take away, yet did he not looſe the Glory of Martyrdome.</p>

And therfore when in ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke place, he had bin at any time viſited by our Lord, he alwaies gaue ſome other matter of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, vnto the ſtanders by, leaſt that the familiar loue tokens of the ſpouſe, ſhould be outwardely obſerued, and reported abroade. As for muche ſpitting, groaning, deepe ſighes, and outward ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, during the time he praied amongſt his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren, he altogether eſchewed them: either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loued to be ſecrete, in thoſe thinges, or els becauſe in his inward cogitatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was whole borne vp alofte into Cod. And oftentimes in this ſorte he would ſpeake vnto his familiars, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſervant of God, in time of praier is viſited fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aboue, he ought forth with to ſay vnto him, Thou O Lord, haſt ſent this comfort from heaven vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me a ſinner and vnworthy perſon, and I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite the fame againe vnto thy cuſtody, becauſe I
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13275:66"/>perceaue my ſelfe to be but a robber of thy divine treaſure, And when he returneth from pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, he ought to ſhewe himſelfe as very a poore wretch and as much a ſinner, as if he had obtained no ſuch new grace an favour at all</p>
               <p>But it chaunced vpon a time when the man of God was praieng in the place of <hi>Portiuncula</hi> that the Biſhopp of <hi>Aſsiſium</hi> came vnto him to viſite him, according to his accuſtomed manner. Who ſo ſoone as he entred into the place, did ouer bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approach vnto the Cell whearein the ſervant of Chriſt did pray, but having knockt at the little doore, and putting forward himſelfe to enter in, no ſooner had he put in his head and ſeene the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man at praier, but being ſtricken with a ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deine feare, all the partes of his body did looſe their ſtrength, and his vety ſpeach did alſo leaue him. Moreover he being through Gods divine will, by force driven out of the place, was ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely borne backe a good way of. Whereat the Biſhoppe being much aſtoniſhed, made haſt to the brethren as faſt as he could: and God then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring vnto him his ſpeache againe; in the firſt wordes he ſpake, he confeſſed his fault.</p>
               <p>One other time alſo it happened, that the Abbot of the monaſtery of <hi>S. Iuſtine,</hi> which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Biſhoppricke of <hi>Peruſium,</hi> did meete the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaunt of Chriſte. Vpon whoſe ſight, the devout Abbot did ſpeedily alight from his horſe: aſwell to doe, reuerence vnto the man of God; as alſo to conferre with him vpon ſome things concerning the health &amp; well fare of his ſoule. And at length
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13275:66"/>after ſweete conference paſſed betweene them, the Abbot departed, humbly deſiring him, to pray for him. To whom the beloved ſervant of God, anſweared, I will pray for you willingly.
<note place="margin">Behold the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full force of Saint Francis his praier.</note> So the Abbot being nowe gone a little way of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full man Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> ſaied vnto his companion, expecte a while my brother becauſe I deſire to pay the debt, which I haue promiſed. But meane while that he contineued in prayer, the Abbot ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinely felt in himſelfe in an vnuſuall kinde of warmeth and ſwetnes, vntill that time altogether vnknowen vnto him: and that in ſuch degree, that being brought into an extaſie of the minde, he fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wholy from himſelfe into Almighty God. And ſo for ſome little ſpace he remained: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes returning into himſelfe againe, he did well perceiue the efficacie of the prayer of holy Saint <hi>Francis.</hi> For which cauſe he was evermore infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with a greater love vnto the Order, and vnto many he reported this fact for a miracle.</p>
               <p>The holy man was alwaies accuſtomed,
<note place="margin">Loe with what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion &amp; attention he reciteth his canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> with no leſſe reverent feare, then attentiue devotion, to recite his Canonicall howers. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he was troubled with the infirmity of his eies, of his ſtamacke, of his ſpleene and liuer: yet would he not leane againſt any wall or reſting place while he did ſing his ſeruice: but euermore acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished his howers, bearing himſelf vpright, with his head vncovered, his eies, vnremoued, and without any manner of cutting shorte his wordes and ſentences. And if at any time he were in ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he nevertheleſſe made ſtay for the time, in no
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13275:67"/>ſorte omitting this holy and reuerent cuſtome, for whatſoeuer aboundance of raine and flouds, that might come vpon him. For thus he would often ſay. If the body doe quietly eate this preſent foode which ſhall with the ſame become the meate of wormes: with howe great peace and quietneſſe is it then expedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for the ſoule to receiue the foode and ſuſtenance of life. Wherfore he did thinke himſelfe greivouſly to offend, if at any time while he was at prayer, he were inwardly diſtracted with vaine fantaſies. And when any ſuch thing had chaunced to be fall; he made no ſpare, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with by confeſſion to purge himſelfe thereof. Which his ſo ſinguler a care, he had converted into ſo vſuall an habite, that he was exceeding rarely troubled with ſuch kinde of flees,</p>
               <p>He had in one lent ſeaſon, made a certaine litle veſſel to over paſſe ſome short moments of time, that they alſo, might not be loſt in idleneſſe. Which comming once into his memory as he was ſaying his third hower, &amp; hauing then in ſome li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle degree diſtracted his minde: he was there vpon ſo moved with feruour of ſpiritte, that he conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the ſame in the fire ſaying: I wil ſacrifice it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Lord, whoſe ſacrifice it hath impeached. He vſed to recite his pſalmes with ſoe great attention of minde and ſpiritte, as if he had God ever preſent before him: and when he chanced in them to finde the name of our Lord, he ſeemed euen to licke his lipps, for the very abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dant delight, of the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he taſted therein. And being alſo deſirous with a moſt eſpeciall reverence to honour the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:13275:67"/>name of our Lorde, and that not only thought, but alſo named and written he did ſometimes per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade his brethren, togather vp al the litle ſcrapps of paper that might any where be founde, contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame, &amp; them to put, in ſome cleane and decent place, leaſt it might haply chance, that the ſacred name written therein ſhould be trodden vnder foote. But the name of Ieſus, when he did either ſpeake it or heare it, did inwardly ſo fill him with ſuch a ſinguler kinde of exvltation, that he thereby ſeemed to be altogether chaunged, euen exteriourly, as if ſome mellifluous ſwetenes had altered his taſt, or ſome harmoniacall ſounde his hearing.</p>
               <p>But in the third yeare before his death, it came to paſſe, that for the ſtirring vp of greater devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he purpoſed to celebrate the feſtivall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the birth of the childe Ieſus, at the village of <hi>Graecium,</hi> withal the greateſt ſolemnity that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he could. And to the end the ſame might not be imputed to levitie: he craved licence of the <hi>Pope;</hi> and having obtained the ſame, he cauſed a manger to be prepared, as alſo hay to be gotten, and an oxe and an Aſſe to be brought to the place. The brethren were called togither; the people aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled themſelues, the woode adioyning was ful of voyces, and that venerable night, was by meane of many cleare ſhining lights, of lowde ſoundinge and harmoniacall praiſes, made to be, both very light ſome, and full of ſolemnity. There ſtood the man of God before the manger, full of devotion, beſprinkled with teares: and overcome with ioy.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:13275:68"/>The holy ſacrifice of the Maſſe was ſolemnely ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated vpon the manger, &amp; the Leuite of Chriſte S. FRANCIS, did ſing the Ghoſpell. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes, vnto the people that ſtood about him, he preached of the nativity of the poore King: and ever as he named him, he did for the very tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of loue, call him the child of Bethlem. But in this meane while, a certaine ſouldier, of great ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and creditte, called <hi>Maiſter Iohn of Graecium,</hi> who hauing for the loue of Chriſte forſaken the ſecular warfare, was now in great familiarity conioined vnto this ſeruant of God, did teſtifie himſelfe to haue ſeene, a litle child of great comlineſſe lieing a ſleepe in that manger: whom, the Bleſſed Father <hi>S.

And this viſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout ſouldier, not only the holineſſe of him that beheld the ſame, did make to be credible: but the very evident truth thereof, did vndoubtedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue it, and the miracles ſucceding, did alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme it. For the example of holy <hi>S.

               </head>
               <p>BVT vnto ſo great a perſpicacity of minde, had the vnwearied cuſtome of prayer, together with the continuall exerciſe of vertues, brought this holy man of God, that albeit he had no skill in the holy ſacred ſcriptures by the ordinarie courſe of learning, yet nevertheleſſe being enlightened with the beames of eternall light, he did ſearche the depth of them with a wonderfull ſharpeneſſe of vnderſlanding. For his conceite being pure from all manner of blemiſh, did penetrate into the moſt hidden miſteries: and where the ſcience of the Doctour did ſtand without doores, even there was the affection of the lover, admitted to enter in. Sometimes he did reade in the holy bookes, and what ſoeuer he did once take in his minde, he did moſt firmely imprint in his memory: not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing in vaine, with the bare preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of his minde, but ruminating therevppon, with an affection of continuall devotion. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once demanded by his brethren, if he did like, that the men of learning, who were alreadie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted vnto the order, ſhould ſtill attend vnto the ſtudy of the holy ſcriptures, he anſweared: It li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me truly very well but yet ſoe, that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the example of Chriſte, of whom we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue, that he did more frequently pray, than reade, they do in no waies omit the exerciſe of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:13275:69"/>prayer, nor yet doe ſo giue themſelues to ſtudy, as only to knowe howe they ought to ſpeake: but to practiſe the things they haue learnd &amp; when they haue donne thoſe things themſelves, then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes to propoſe them vnto others to doe the like. For I would (ſaid he) that my brethren ſhould be diſciples of the Goſpell, &amp; that ſoe they ſhould profitte in the knowledge of the truth, as that therewith all, they doe alſo increaſe in the pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſimplicity: whereby they doe not ſeparate from the prudence of the ſerpent, the ſimplicity of the done: which our chiefe maiſter hath with his owne bleſſed mouth, conioyned therevnto.</p>
               <p>Being demaunded at <hi>Sienna,</hi> by a certaine reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſe man, whoe was Doctor of divinity, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning certaine queſtions which were very difficult &amp; hard to be vnderſtood: he did with ſuch a clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of doctrine, diſcouer the ſecretts of Gods divine wiſedome, that the ſame learned man, was thereat greatly amazed, and with much admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, did ſay: Vndoubtedly the divinity of this holy Father, is like as it were an Eagle, borne vp a lofte with the wings of purity, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, but our knowledg, creepeth belowe, vpon the ground. For though he were but euen vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the manner of ſpeaking, yet was he ſo full of heauenly knowledg, that he explicated moſt doubtfull queſtions, and produced to light many hidden and ſecret things. Neither is it to be held for ſtrange, that the holy man had from Almighty God receaued, the vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures: ſeeing that by the perfect imitation of Chriſte, he
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13275:69"/>did beare the truth of them, liuely expreſſed in his workes: and that by the plentifull vnction of the Holy Ghoſte, he had the teacher of them abiding with him in his harte.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſingulerly alſo did the ſpirite of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy appeare in him, that he did not only foreſee fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture things, but did alſo ſee into the hidden ſecrets of mens harts: &amp; did moreouer behold the things that were abſent, as though they were preſent, in marveilouſe manner exhibiting himſelf, preſent, vnto thoſe that were abſent. For at that time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the army of the Chriſtians did beſeige the cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Damiata,</hi> the ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of God cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ced to be there: not armed with weapons, but with firmeneſſe of faith. Vpon the very day therfore, when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were readie prepared to make the aſſault, the ſervaunt of Chriſte, vnderſtanding ſo much, did fetch a moſt deepe &amp; hartie ſight; and therewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſaid vnto his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion: Our Lord hath ſhewen vnto me that if the battell be vndertaken, it shall not proſperouſly ſucceede vnto the Chriſtians. But if I shall diſcover the ſame, I shal be reputed a foole: and if I shall conceale it, I shall not eſcape the grudge of myne owne conſcience. What doe you therfore aduiſe to be donne in this caſe. Vnto whom his companion anſweared, ſaying. Brother let it be of no moment vnto you, to be cenſured by the mouths of men: for you doe not nowe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne, to be reputed a foole. Diſcharge therefore your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſcience, &amp; feare God more than me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Vpon the hearing of which wordes, out ſtepped the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phette; applying to the Chriſtians his behouefull
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:13275:70"/>admonitions: he did forbidde them the conflict, and denounced the euent. But the truth was taken for a fable, they hardened their harts &amp; would not returne. See therefore? They did indeed encounter together, and ioyne in battell: but all the Chriſtian forces were put to flight, and the army was beaten back with much diſhonor, and without triumphe. And in ſuch degree was the number of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians diminished, which the greatneſſe of the ſlaughter, that about ſixe thowſand perſonnes were ſlaine and taken. Wherein it did euidently appeare that the wiſedome of the poore man was not to be deſpiſed: conſidering that. <hi>The ſoule of the iuſt man, shall ſometimes diſcouer the truth, more than ſeauen ſentinells,

               <p>Another time alſo after his returne from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, he came to preache at <hi>Celanum:</hi> and euen then a certaine ſouldier, did with great devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much inſtancy invite him to dinner.

And when his prayer was donne, he familiarely called aſide his curteous Hoſte, and ſpake in this wiſe vnto him: Loe nowe brother Hoſte, at the inſtancie of your earneſt requeſts, I haue entred into your houſe, to eate with you.

But at the length they ſate them downe at the Table: and when the reſt beganne to eate, ſodeinely the hoſte himſelfe gaue vp the Goſt: being taken away with ſode in death according to the worde of the man of God. And ſo it came to paſſe by the meritte of Hoſpitality, that the devoute ſouldier <hi>Receauing a Prophette, did</hi> (according to the word of truth) <hi>receaue the reward of a Prophette:</hi> while he giving creditt vnto the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall forewarning of the holy man, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide himſelfe againſt the ſodeine aſſault of death, that being armed with the weapons of pennance, he might eſcape endleſſe damnation; and might enter, into the eternall tabernacles.</p>
               <p>One time when the holy men lay ſicke at <hi>Reate</hi> a certaine Prebend named <hi>Gedeon,</hi> a looſe &amp; word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, keeping his bedde vpon occaſion of a ſore and grievouſe infirmity; being brought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe vnto him, did with teares, aſwell by himſelfe as by the ſtanders by, inſtantly requeſte

But yet for the devout de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of your frends, I do ſigne you with the ſigne of the Croſſe, in the name of our Lord.

<note place="margin">S. Francis making the ſigne of the Croſse vpon a ſick man he forthwith becometh whole.</note> the latter pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties are alwaies worſe than the former. Thus therefore the ſigne of the Croſſe being made vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, he who lay but even now contracted before them. did forth with riſe vp perfectly well reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: and burſting forth into the praiſe of God, I am, ſaith he, even now delivered. And the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chine bones of his back, did giue a great found in the hearing of all that were preſent: euen as though a ſorte of drie ſticks had binne broken by hand. But within very ſmall time after, this man, forgetfull of Gods benefits vnto him, gaue ouer his body vnto vnchaſte delights. And when he was one evening at ſupper in a certaine Cannons houſe; and did there lodge for all that night ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deinely the roofe of the houſe fell downe vpon them al. But yet ſo that all the reſt finding meane of eſcape from death, only this vnfortunate and wretched man, was in that fall intercepted and ſlaine. Thus therefore by the iuſt iudgement of
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:13275:71"/>God, the laſt things of this man, became worſe than the former; becauſe of the vice of ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and for his contempt of God: whereas he ought to haue binne thankefull for the pardon he had already receaved, conſidering that a crime re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, is a double offence.</p>
               <p>Another time alſo, a certaine noble and very devout woman, came vnto this holy Saint, aſwel to explicate vnto him her ſorrowe and griefe, as alſo for the ſame to require a remedy. For ſhe had a very cruel husband, who alſo was adverſe vnto her in the ſervice of Chriſt. And therefore ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the holy man to pray for him, that God of his clemency would vouchſafe to mollifie his hart. But he vnderſtanding her caſe, gaue anſwere vnto her, ſaying, Go your wais home in peace, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt or dreade, expect forthwith to finde comfort at your husbands hands.

Lady, let vs attend to the ſervice of our Lord, and let vs indevour our ſelues to ſaue our foules.

               </p>
               <p>There was a brother, who outwardly ſeemed to be of great holineſſe, and of very excellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But it was not many daies after, that he went out of religion, whereby it evidently appeared, with what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent clearneſſe, of internall ſight, the man of God had beholden the ſecreas of his harte. And in like manner, with infallible truth foretelling, the cuine and fall of many that ſeemed to ſtand, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo

               <p>For vpon a time, his Vicar held a Chapter: but he in the meane while, remained aparte in his Cell at praier, as a mediatour, betweene the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and God. And when one of them, vnder ſome cloake and pretext of defence, did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe vnto diſcipline, the holy man, even then, beholding the ſame in ſpirit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e: called one of the brethren and ſaied vnto him, Brother, I haue ſeene the Diuell ſitting vppon the backe of that diſobedient brother, &amp; him, ſtraitly to hold his neck: who being ſpurred on wardes by ſuch a rider, and contemning the raines of obedience, did follow the ſway, of his owne violent motion. And when I did pray vnto God; for the brother, ſodeinely the Diuell, with ſhame, departed. Goe therefore, and ſay vnto him, that he doe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſubmit his nock vnto the yoke of holy obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He therefore being by the Meſſenger ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished, and preſently converted vnto God, did humbly proſtrate himſelfe, at the Vicats fete.</p>
               <p>Another time alſo it chaunced that two of the brethren came from a farre of to the Ermitage of <hi>Grecium</hi> to ſee the man of God, and to returne with his benediction, which they had now long time deſired. But comming thither, and not fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, becauſe he was then returned from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blique
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:13275:74"/>place to be ſolitary in his Cell: they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted away, penſiue and deſolate. And ſee euen as they were in going, the holy man, whereas according to humane vnderſtanding, he coulde haue no knowledg either of their goeing or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet nevertheleſſe contrary to his vſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, came out of his Cell, and calling aloude after them, according to their deſire, did bleſſe them with the figne of the Croſſe in the name of Chriſt. Ther came two brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vpon a time from the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of labour: whereof the auncentier brother gaue ſoundry ſcandals vnto the yonger. But when the were both come to the Father, he asked of the yonger, how the brother his companion had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved himſelfe towards him in the way. Who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwearing ſurely, well enough. The Father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. Beware brother, leaſt vnder the pretence of humility, you make a lie: for I know, I know, but marke a while, and you shall ſee. The bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marveiled very much, how he, by force of the ſpiritte, could haue knowledg of things that were donne ſo farre from him. But within fewe daies after, that other brother, who had given the ſcandall vnto him, not having asked pardon of the Father, nor yet having receaved due diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline for the ſame, ſeting nought by his Order, did forſake his covent. In whoſe fall and ruine, two things are at once to be conſidered: namly the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſſe of Gods divine iuſtice, and the ſinguler perſpicuity of his propheticall ſpiritte. But in what manner of wiſe: by force of Gods mighty power he did exhibite himſelfe preſent vnto them
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:13275:75"/>that were abſent from him, it is evidently to be ſeene out of the things before recited: if it be well recalled to minde, how he being abſent from the brethren, nevertheleſſe appeare vnto them, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured in a fiery Chariotte; and how alſo he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf vnto them, in the forme of a Croſſe at the Chapter of Alres.

               <p>THE right loyall ſeruaunte, and faithfull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſte, Sainct <hi>Francis,</hi> to the end he might both faithfully and perfectly, accomplish all the things committed vnto him, did moſt eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially addict himſelf, vnto thoſe exerciſes of vertue which by revelation of the holy ſpiritte, he knewe to be moſt pleaſing to his beloved Lorde. Vpon occaſion whereof, it chaunced him to fall, into a greate agonie of a certaine kind of doubtfulneſſe: which for many daies together, at his returne from prayer, he did purpoſe vnto his familiar brethrene, to be by them determined. What councel, ſaid he, doe ye giue vnto me my brethrene? What doe ye commende vnto me? Whither that I should attend vnto prayer, or trauel abroad to preache For I, litle one that I am beinge ſimple and rude of ſpeache, haue receaued at Gods hands a greater grace, in praying, than in ſpeaking. There ſeemeth alſo, in prayer to be a gaine, and heaping vp of graces, but in preaching, a certaine kind of diſtribution of the gifts from heauen receaued: in prayer a gaine, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be a purifiyng of the inward affections and an vniting of them, vnto the one, true &amp; chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt good, together with a ſtrengthening of vertue but in preaching a beduſting of the ſpiritual feete, a diſtraction about many things, and a ſlackening
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:13275:76"/>In prayer breiflly, we ſpeake vnto God, and therin alſo we heare him, and leading as it were an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall life, we doe converſe among Angells: wheras in preaching, we muſt condiſcend in many things vnto men, and liuing according vnto humane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome among them, we muſt thinke vpon humane things, we muſt ſee them, ſpeake of them, &amp; heare them. But one thing is yet to be ſaied, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie parte, which ſeemeth to ouer ballance all theſe things, before the face of God: namely that the only begotten ſonne of God, who is the very height of wiſedome it ſelf, did come downe from his Fathers boſome, for the ſalvation of ſoules, that inſtructing the world, by his owne example, he might preache the worde of ſalvation, vnto men whom he was to redeeme, with the price, to cleanſe, with the lauer, and to ſuſtaine, with the Cup, of his moſt holy and ſacred blood, not reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any thing vnto himſelfe, which he did not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally beſtowe for our ſalvation. And co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidering that we ought to doe all things, according to the patterne of thoſe things which we ſee in him, as it were vpon a hight and loftie hill: it ſeemeth more pleaſing to God, that intermitting the courſe of reſt, I ſhould goe for the vnto labour. And hauing in this manner, conferred with his brethrene for many daies together, he could not certainely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, whether of theſe courſes, was rather to be taken, as being indeed, more truly acceptable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſte. For though, by the ſpiritte of prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cye, he did knowe wonderfull things, yet of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he was not able clearely to reſolve this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;

This true Minor who had learnt great things of the moſt excellent Maiſter, was not aſhamed to aske litle things, of them that were indeed, leſſer than himſelf. For he was alwaies accuſtomed with eſpeciall diligence to enquire, by what way and by what manner of meane, he might more perfectly ſerve God, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto his good will and pleaſure. This was his chiefeſt philoſophy, this was his chiefeſt deſire, ſo long as he lived: to learne of the wiſe, and of the ſimple, of the perfect and of the vnperfect, of litle ones, and of aged perſons, how he might be able, more efficaciouſly to aſpire, vnto the very topp of perfection.</p>
               <p>Calling therfore vnto him, two of his brethren he ſent them to brother <hi>Silueſter,</hi> who had before time ſeene the Croſſe iſſueing forth of his mouth, &amp; did even nowe, continually attend vnto prayer, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the hill aboue <hi>Aſsiſium:</hi> requiring him to ſeeke Gods diuine anſweare concerning this doubt, and accordingly to ſend word, vnto him. In like ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner alſo, he gave in charge, to the holy virgin <hi>S. Clare,</hi> that by ſomeone of the pureſt and ſimpleſt virgins living vnder her diſcipline, she her ſelf alſo praying; with the reſt of her Siſters, should vpon this pointe, deſire to knowe the will of our Lord. And marveilouſly doubtleſſe, by the revelation of Gods heavenly ſpiritte, did this venerable Preiſt,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13275:77"/>and the conſecrated virgin, agree in one: namely that it was the bleſſed will and pleaſure of God, that the meſſenger of Chriſte should goe forthe, to preache. And ſo accordingly, the holy man, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, at the returne of the brethren, by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved the will of our Lord, in ſuche wiſe as had binne related vnto them, did forth with addreſſe himſelf, and without any manner of delay, did vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake his iorney. But with ſo great a fervour they went, to accompliſhe Gods diuine comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, yea and ſo ſpeedily did he runne a long, as if (the hand of our Lorde beinge newly made vpon him) he had euen then put on a newe vertue from heauen.</p>
               <p>And as he did in this ſorte drawe night to <hi>Beua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> he came vnto a certaine place, wherein was aſſembled, an exceeding greate multitude of birdes. of diuers ſorts. Which, when the holy man of God had eſpied; he ranne chearefully vnto the place, and did alſo ſalute them, as if they had binne partakers of reaſon. But as they ſtoode all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, and turning themſelues vnto him, ſo that thoſe which were euen in the low ſhrubes, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe their heads, as he approached vnto them, did afteran vnwonted manner looke and gaze vpon him, he came euen very cloſe, vnto them: and ſeriouſly admonished them all, to heare the worde of God. Saying, yea birdes, my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threne, you are much bounde to praiſe your crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, whoe hath clothed you with feathers, &amp; hath given you wings to flie, who hath graunted vnto you the purity of the aire, and doth governe you
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13275:77"/>without your owne care and trouble. And when he had ſpoken to this and the like effect, the litle birdes, after a marveilouſe manner, reioycing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſtretch out their neckes, to ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad ther wings, to open their bills, and to looke attentively vpon him. But he paſſing through the middeſt of them, with a wonderfull fervour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte, although he touched them with his coate, yet did not one of them all ſtirre forth of the place vntill ſuch time as the man of God hauing made the ſigne of the Croſſe vpon them, and giuen them leaue to departe with his benediction alſo recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, they all flewe away together. All theſe things were ſeene of his companions, that ſtaied for him in the way. Vnto whom the pure and ſimple man returning, beganne (for that he had not before this time, preached vnto the birdes) to reproue himſelf, of an ouerſighte, and negligence.</p>
               <p>And afterwards at he went a long, preaching in the places, adioyning he came to a certaine towne called <hi>Aluianum:</hi> where hauing gathered the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, and ſilence being alſo enioyned he could yet ſcantly be heard, by reaſon of a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of ſwallowes then building their neſts, and making a marvoilouſe chattering noyſe, in the place. Vnto them therfore, the man of God ſpake, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them all: Saying, yea ſwallowes my ſiſters, it is nowe time, that I alſo doe ſpeake: for that you haue ſpoken enough already. Harken nowe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vnto the worde of God, and keepe ſilence, vntill the ſame be ended. But they as though they had binne capable of vnderſtanding; did ſo deinely
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13275:78"/>ceaſe their noiſe: and moved not out of the place, vntill the whole Sermon was at an end wher vpon all that were preſent, and did beholde the ſame, being filled with wonder and admiration, did glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God therein. The fame of this miracle, being ſpreade abroade on every ſide, did kindle in many the devotion of faith; and a reverence alſo, to this holy Saint.</p>
               <p>For in the Cittie of PARIS, a certaine ſcholer of good towardlineſſe, attending diligently vnto ſtudy, among other his companiens, &amp; being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted with the tedious and vnſeaſonable noiſe of a certaine ſwallowe, beganne to ſay vnto thoſe his companions; This ſwallowe, doubtleſſe is one of them, which troubled holy <hi>Francis</hi> the man of God, one time, in his Sermon, vntill he had put them to ſilence. And turning himſelf to the ſwallowe; he confidently ſaid, vnto her, in the name of <hi>Francis,</hi> the ſeruante of God, I commaunde thee, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thou come vnto me, and hold thy peace. But shee ſo ſoone as she heard the name of Saint <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,</hi> being as it were inſtructed, by the precepts of the man of God, did both incontinently, ceaſe her noyſe, and did alſo, readily committe her ſelfe vnto his hande, as to a ſure and ſafe cuſtodie. Whereat the ſcholler, being muche aſtonished, reſtored her forth with to libertie, and heard no more of her chattering.</p>
               <p>Another time alſo, when the ſeruaunte of God preached at <hi>Caieta;</hi> vpon the ſea shore, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple thronged vpon him for very deuotion to touche him; the ſeruant of Chriſte, loathing ſo

And therefore it was, by the Oracle of God inſpired into his minde, that in the opening of the booke of the Ghoſpell, Chriſt would vouchſafe, to reueale, vnto him, what should be moſt acceptable vnto God, in him, and concerning him.

And albeit that by reaſon of the continuall auſteritie, of his life formerly paſt, and of his conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall bearing our Lorde his Croſſe, he was nowe but weake of bodie, yet was he nothing terrified therewithall: but was more forcibly animated, to the ſuſtaining of martirdome. For the inſuperable burning loue of good Ieſus, had encreaſed within him, to lampes of fire and flames: ſoe that many waters were notable to quenche his ſoe prevalent Charitie.</p>
               <p>Being therefore with the Seraphicall fervour of deſires borne vp alofte into God, and by the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of compaſſion, transformed into him, who of his ſurpaſſing charitie, would vouch ſafe to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified; one morning about the Feaſt of the Exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the holy Croſſe, while he did pray vpon the ſide of the hill, he ſawe a Seraphin, with ſix wings all fierie and full of gloriouſe light, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding downe from the toppe of the heauens. And as he came with a ſwifte flighte, to that place of the aire which was neare to the man of God, there appeared betweene his wings, the forme of a man crucified, hauing his handes and feete ſtretcht out, in manner of a Croſſe, and faſtened alſo, vnto a Croſſe. Two of his wings were lifted vp, aboue his heade, two were ſtreeched forth, to flie; and two, did couer, his whole body. At the beholding wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was exceedingly amazed: and there entred
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13275:83"/>his hatte, a loy, mingled with ſorrowe. For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyced in that gracious aſpect, whereby he percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued himſelfe to be beholden of Chriſt, vnder the forme of a Seraphim: but, the faſtening to the Croſſe, did peirce through his ſoule, with a ſworde of compaſſionate greife.

But in the end he herehence percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, our Lord reuealing the ſame vnto him, that therefore this manner of viſion, was by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, in ſuche manner of wiſe, preſented vnto his veiwe, that he the friend of Chriſt might thereby forknow, that he was wholy to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, into the likeneſſe of Chriſt crucified, not by the martir dome of his flesh, but by the burning inflammation of his minde.</p>
               <p>The viſion therefore, diſappearing, did leaue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, a wounderfull heate, in his harte: and a no leſſe wonderfull impreſſion of ſignes, in his flesh. For preſently there beganne to appeare in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds and feete, the ſignes of nailes, euen in ſuch manner as a litle before he had ſeene them, in the likeneſſe of the crucified man. For his hands and feete ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be in the very middeſt, peirced with nailes: the heades of them nailes appearing, in the inner parte of his handes, and the outer parte of his feete but the pointes of them, on the contrary ſides. And the heades of the nailes, in his hands &amp; feete, were rounde and blacke: but the pointes were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what long and wreathed, and as it were clinched:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13275:84"/>which riſing vppe, out of the very flesh, did ſticke out higher than the reſt of the flesh. His righte ſide alſo, as being pearced through with a ſpeare, was couered ouer with a redde skarre: which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, caſting out holy bloud: did beſprincle, his coate and breeches therewithall.</p>
               <p>But the ſervante of Chriſt perceauing that thoſe markes ſo plainely imprinted in his flesh could not to be hidden from his familiar companions; and fearing nevertheleſſe, to publishe the ſecrette of our Lord, was in a greate agony and doubt of minde, whether he should vtter or conceale the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which had binne shewed vnto him. Wherfore he called together ſome of the brethren, &amp; ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnto them in generall tearmes, he propoſed his doubt before them, and required their councel and adviſe therein.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13275:85"/>greivous plague: which did ſoe cruelly conſume all the sheepe and Oxen, that no manner of remedie could be applied vnto them. But behold, a certaine devout man that feared God, was by viſion in the night time admonished, haſtily to goe vnto the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage of the brethren: and that taking the water, wherein the ſervaunte of God Saint <hi>Francis</hi> (who then remained in that place) had washed his hands and feete; he ſhould ſprinckle the ſame vpon al the beaſts. Riſing therefore earely in the morning, he came to the place: &amp; having prively obtained this water by meane of the companions of the holy man, he ſprincled the ſicke sheepe and Oxen, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. Nowe ſee the wonder. As ſoone as the ſprinckling had in any ſmall quantitie once tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the beaſts, that lay before languishing vpon the ground, they preſently roſe vp, as hauing nowe perfectly recouered their wonted ſtrength: and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily went, vnto their feede and paſture: as thought they had felt no harme at all. Whereby it came to paſſe, that by the admirable vertue of that water, which had but touched thoſe ſacred woundes, all manner of plague, did vtterly ceaſe, &amp; the peſtilent diſeaſe, was driven quite away, from the flocks.</p>
               <p>About the foreſaid mountaine of <hi>Aluerna,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſuch time as the holy man, did make his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boade in that place, by reaſon of a cloude, that roſe out of the very mountaine, it ſelfe: a violent tempeſt of haile, did cuſtomably diſtroy the fruits of the earth; but after that happy apparition, not without the great wonder of all the inhabitants, the haile did ceaſe. So that by the very face of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,

                  </gap> the excellency, of that heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſion, and the efficacie of the ſtigmats, in that place imprinted, was ſufficiently teſsified and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
               <p>It chaunced alſo once, in the winter time, that being, in regard of the weakeneſſe of his owne bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of the aſperouſneſſe alſo of the waies, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried vpon a certaine poore mans Aſſe, he was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to lodge all night vnder the edge of a certaine out bending rocke: whereby he might in ſome ſorte avoied the inconveniences of the ſnowe and night which came in ſuch manner of wiſe vpon him, that he could not reache to the place appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his lodging. But the holy man in the meane while perceaving, that the other poore man did murmure &amp; (as it were) complaine, by his groanes, &amp; toſſing himſelfe on either ſide, as one who having but ſmal &amp; ſlender couering, could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take any reſt for the extreame bitterneſſe of the cold: and being enkindled with the fervour of divine loue, did ſtreech out his hand and touche the man. Marveilouſe doubtleſſe was the effect thereof. For preſently at the touche of that holy hande, which bare in it ſelfe the burning heate of the Seraphicall ſtone, all manner of cold, being quite expelled, there came ſuch an heate vpon the poore man, both inwardly &amp; with out, as if a flame of fire, from with in a furnace, had breathed out vpon him. For preſently being comforted both in minde and in body, he ſlept more ſweetely among the ſtones and the ſnowe, vntill the morning, than
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13275:86"/>euer he had reſted in his owne bed: as ne himſelfe afterwards did affirme. Wherefore it is manifeſt by moſt certaine tokens, that thoſe holy ſignes were imprinted by his vertue and power, whoe by a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphicall operation, doth purge, illuminate, and in flame, ſeeing that theſe ſignes did both purge from the plague, and with wonderfull efficacie conferre healthe, cleareneſſe, and heate vpon bodies; as alſo after his death it was demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtrated by moſt evident miracles, which heareafter we will ſet downe in their due place.</p>
               <p>And though he endeavoured withall his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, to hide the treaſure which he had found in the feilde; yet could it not be ſoe concealed, but that ſome did perceaue and ſee, the holy marks of his hands and feete: notwithſtanding that he did (in manner continually) carry his handes covered, and did alſo, from that time forwarde, weare shoes vpon his feete. For they were ſeene euen in his life time, by ſundrie of his brethren: whoe albeit that for their ſinguler holineſſe, they were in all reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects very worthy to be believed; yet vtterly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue all ſcruple and doubt, laieing their handes vpon the holy Ghoſpels, they did by ſolemne oathe avowe, that ſoe it was, and that they themſelues had ſeene them. Some of the Cardinalls alſo, by reaſon of the familiaritie which they had with the holy man, did in like manner ſee thoſe ſacred ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mats: the praiſes whereof they haue truly inſerted into Proaſes Himnes, and Anthemes which they haue ſer forth in his honor: whoe as wel by worde, as by writing; haue given teſtimony vnto the

Pope <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> preaching once vnto the people before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the brethren, my ſelfe alſo being then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; did affirme that he had with his owne eies ſeene thoſe holy ſtigmats, while the Sainte was yet aliue. And at the time of his death, they were ſeene and beheld, by more than fiftie of the brethren; by the moſt devout Virgin <hi>S. Clare,</hi> together with the reſt of her ſiſters; and by ſecular parſons not to be numbred. Amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt whom, many (as shal be shewed in place convenient) haue both kiſſed them, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and haue touched them with their handes, for confitmation of their reſtimony.</p>
               <p>But the wounde of his ſide, he covered with ſo greate carefulneſſe that whilſt he liued, no man could come, but by ſtealth, to ſee it. For one of the brethren, whoe was woont diligently to miniſter vnto him, hauing out of a Godly kinde of care, vpon a time perſwaded him to put of his coate, to the end it might be made cleane, watching heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with his eye, did ſee the wounde: wherevnto alſo ſpeedily applieng three of his fingers, he did aſwell by ſighte as by feeling, diſcerne the qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity thereof. And by the like manner of heedefulneſſe did that brother alſo ſee it, whoe was at that time his Vicar. But the brother that was his companion a man verely of marveilouſe ſimplicitie, meane while that he touched his shoulders, which were fainte and weake, by reaſon of ſome infirmity, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his hand by his hood, and lefting it by chance to fall vpon the wounde, did put him to greate paine thereby. Wherefore after that time, he had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13275:87"/>his breeches ſo made, that they reached vp to his arme pitts, to cover the wound of his ſide But the brethren who, for the time being, did wash the breeches, or had his coate to make cleane, becauſe they founde the ſame to be made red with blood, did vndoubtedly, by that evident ſigne, come to the knowledg of that ſacred wounde: which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when he was dead, they with many others beſides, did in open viewe behold and reuerence.</p>

For nowe, becauſe of the Stigmats of our Lord Ieſus, which thou beareſt in thy body, no man ought to be moleſtfull vnto thee: but rather everie ſervaunte of Chriſt, is bounde to be devout towards thee withal affection. Now by theſe moſt evident ſignes, approved not vnto two or three witteneſſes, for ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cy; but vnto very many, for ſuperabundance; the teſtimonies of God, being in thee, &amp; by thee, made to to much to be beleiued, doe take away from Infidells, all vaile and colour of excuſe: meane while that by them, the beleivers are in faith eſtablished: by the confidence of hope borne vp alofte, and with the fier of Charitie, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed.

In ſo much that, through ſundrie, long and continuall ſickneſſes, he was finally brought to that paſſe, that his flesh being nowe quite conſumed. he was as it were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but skinne and bones. And being preſſed in body with hard and greiuous afflictions, yet would he never reckon of them by the name of paines, but would call them by the name of Siſters.

               <p>But he knewe the time of his deathe long before and the day of his departure being euen now at hand, he ſaied vnto his brethren, that he was very preſently to put of the tabernacle of his body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as had binne by Chriſt revealed vnto him. Having therefore bin for two yeates ſpace, from the impreſſion of his ſacred Stigmats as namely from the twentith yeare after his converſion, by many hard triyng ſtroakes of diſtresfull infiemities he wed and ſquared out, as a well polished ſtone, fitte to be placed in the building of the heavenly Hieruſalem, and having alſo as a peice of forge worke, vnder the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mer of manifold tribulations, binne finally brought to perfection, he required himſelfe to be carried to the place of our Ladie of <hi>Portiuncula,</hi> that where he had receaued, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritte of grace, there might herender vp, his ſpiritte of life.

Thus having nowe diſapparelled himſelfe, even of his poore ſackcloth garment, and lieing in this wiſe vpon the earth, he lifted vp his face to heaven, according to his wonted manner: and intending wholy to the glory thereof, he did with his ſeft hand, cover the wounde of his right ſide, that it might not be perceaved.

O moſt Chriſtian man indeed, who by a perfect immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, endeavoured himſelfe to be comfortable, in his life time, to Chriſte, living; in his deathe, to Chriſte, dieing; and after his deathe, to Chriſt alſo, being dead: and was made worthy, to be, with the expreſſe ſimilitude thereof adorned.</p>
               <p>But; the very howre of his paſſage, even now approaching, he cauſed all the brethren that were in that place, to be called vnto him: and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring himſelfe, with comfortable wordes to mittigate the griefe, they conceaued for his death he did with a fatherly affection exhorte them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

And of the preſervation of Patience and Povertie, and of the faith alſo of the Holy Romane Church, he enlarged his ſpeache; preferring the holy Goſpel, before all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. And as his brethren ſatte runde about him, he reached out his handes vpon them, and caſting his atmes overthwart, in manner of the Croſle (becauſe he evermore loved that ſigne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly) he bleſſed all the Brethren, aſwel them that were preſent, as them that were abſent, in the power and name, of him that was crucified.

This admirable man, as being paſſingly ritche in Poverty; and highly advaunced, in Humility; prompt alſo and actiue, in mortification, and prudent, in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, and briefly of ſingular note and obſervance, for al manner of honeſt converſation, whome our Lord had made to be in his life time, wonderfully eſteemed, him did he make to be in his death in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more renowned.

               <p>And true it is that the devout children, did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed shed teares and lament, for the taking away of ſoe loving a Father: but yet were they reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with no ſmall meaſure, of ioy and glade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe, meane while that in him, they did moſt

And for to giue more abſolute and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted aſſurance, vnto al the whole world; of the glorified eſtate, of this moſt holy man: he cauſed the miracles by him donne, having bin formerlie founde out, drawen together in writing, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by convenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t witneſſes, to be examined by ſuch of the Cardinals, as ſeemed to be leſſe favou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable vnto that matter and buſineſſe. After dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t enquirie whereof, the Miracles being by them al fully ratified and allowed, he did, by the vniforme Councel and aſſent of his brethren, and of all the Prelats, that were then reſident in his Courte, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue and decree, to accompliſh his Canonization And comming perſonally vnto the Citty of <hi>Aſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſium,</hi> in the yeare of our Lords incarnation, one thowſand, two hundred: rewentie &amp; eight, he did on Sunday, the ſixteenth of Iuly, with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities, to long to be rehearſed, enrolle the bleſſed-Father, in the Catalogue of Saints.</p>
               <p>But in the yeare of our Lorde, one thowfand, two hundred, and thirtie, the brethren, beinge aſſembled to a generall Chapter, then celebrated and kept, at <hi>Aſsiſium,</hi> the body dedicated vnto our Lord, was on the ſiue and twentith of May, tranſlated vnto a goodly Church, that was built

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13275:96"/>Of whom, what ſoeuer may be ſaied by tonge of man, shalbe inferiour, vnto his due, and worthy praiſe. For the whole indeavour doubtleſſe of the man of God, aſwell that which was publique, as that which was private, was altogether emploied about the Croſſe of our Lord. And to the ende he might outwardly ſigne his body, with the ſigne of the Croſſe, which was from the beginning of his converſion, imprinted in his harte, incompaſſing himſelfe, with in a very Croſſe, he tooke vpon him the habite of pennance: which did plainely repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, the Image and forme of a Croſſe: that even as his minde had inwardly put on that Lord himſelfe that was crucified, ſoe might his bodie alſo put on, the Enſignes and armes of the Croſſe. And that in what ſigne, God Almighty had ſubdued, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the aire: in the ſame, might the armie of this holy man maintaine the warfare of our Lord. But from the beginning of the time wherein he firſt beganne, to ſerue vnder the ſtanderd of the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixe, divers miſteries of the Croſſe, did in gloriouſe manner appeare about him: as to him that shall duely conſider the courſe of his life, it may be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently and clearely knowen, howe by meane of a ſeavenfolde apparition of our Lord his Croſſe, he was aſwell in thought, as in affection and act, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lely by the extaticall loue of him transformed, into the figure and reſemblance, of him that was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. Worthely therefore did the clemency of the higheſt King (beyond all eſtimation of man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcending, vnto thoſe that were his true lovers) deſigne him in his bodie to beare the banner of his
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:13275:97"/>croſſe, that he who had binne forearmed, with a marveilouſe loue of the croſſe, might alſo be made admirable, by a marveilouſe honor of the Croſſe. And for the irrefrigable eſtablishement, of this wondrous miracle, not only the teſtimonies of them that haue both ſeene and felt it, being by all manner of meanes, moſt worthy to be beleived: but alſo, ſundrie marveilouſe apparitions, and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous effects, shining after his death doe helpfully concurre, to driue al cloudish darkeſomneſſe, quite away from the minde. For our moſt holy Lord, of happy memorie. Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth (of whom that bleſſed man had prophetically foretold, that he should be raiſed vp to the dignitie, of the Sea Apoſtolique) did beare in his harte, before ſuch time, as he had enrolled that ſtanderd bearer of the Croſſe, into the Catalogue of Saints, a certaine ſcruple of doubt, concerning the wounde of his ſide. But one night (according as that happy Paſtor, did himſelfe, with teares, reporte) bleſſed Saint <hi>Francis</hi> did with a certaine kinde of diſcontented countenance, in ſleepe appeare, vnto him: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving his doubtfulneſſe of harte, lifted vp his right arme, diſcouered his wounde, and required of him a Phiolle glafle, to gather vp the overflowing bloud, that iſſued out of his ſide. The chiefe Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppe offered him forthwith the Phiolle, by him required: which ſeemed to be with the bloud that came out of his ſide, filled vp euen to the toppe. And from thenceforth, he beganne with ſoe great a devotion to be affected, and with ſoe zealous an emulation to be inflamed, vnto that ſacred miracle
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13275:97"/>that he could by no meanes indure, any man by proude contradiction, preſumptuouſly to diſgrace thoſe illuſtriouſe holy ſignes, but he would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him with a ſevere rebuke.</p>
                  <p>In like manner a certaine Friar Minor, being by office a preacher, and a man of greate note for his excellent fame and vertue, although he were of the holy Stigmattes of this bleſſed Saint, fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, yet ſeeking one time within himſelfe, a reaſon of this miracle, according to the courſe of humane vnderſtanding, did beginne to ſtagger and waver in minde, out of a ſcruple of ſome certaine kinde of doubt. And where as by giving way to his owne ſenſualitie, he did for divers dayes together ſuſtaine, this manner of conflict, Saint <hi>Francis</hi> did one night in ſleepe appeare vnto him, with his feet all durtie, bearing shewe of diſpleaſure, howebeit in humility, and of anger, but yet with in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of patience. And what (ſaied he) meane theſe agonies of diſtruſte, in thee? What meane theſe dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie dreggs, of doubts? Behold my handes, and ſee my feete. Who then beholding his handes to be peirced through, but not yet perceaving, the Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mattes of his bemired feete; remoue away (ſaied the bleſſed Saint) the durte from my feet, &amp; know for certaine the places of the nailes therof. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon, he taking hold of them with great devotion, did ſeeme to wipe of the durte, and with his hands to touche the places of the nailes. And as ſoone as be waked out of his ſleepe, weeping in great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundance, he washed away his former affections (being in a ſorte durted and defiled) no leſſe with a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:13275:98"/>ſtreame of teares, than with publique and open confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>In the Citty of <hi>Rome,</hi> a certaine noble mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which ſhe heedefully obſerving, one day, whileſt ſhe was at her praiers, and therewithall perceaving that it had not the ſacred ſignes of the Stigmattes; beganne thereat not a litle both to ſorrowe and wonder. But it was not marveile, though they were wanting, in the picture; being that they were, by the Painter himſelfe, neglected. Yet nevertheleſſe, whileſt she did for divers daies, in great carfulneſſe of minde, debate with herſelfe, what might be the cauſe of this manner of defect, beholde thoſe marveilouſe ſignes, ſodeinly one day appeared in the picture, even in ſuch ſorte, as in other picturs of the Saint they were wont to be painted. The woman thereat conceyving ſomme feare, fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with called vnto her a devoute daughter of her owne, and earneſtly enquired of her, if the picture had not binne without the Stigmattes, even vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till that very time. Shee for her part, did affirme and ſweare, that of former time; it had benwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe ſacred Stigmattes, and had them nowe therein verely appearing. But becauſe the minde of man, doth oftentimes enforce it ſelfe to falle, and doth alſo frequently cal, the truth into doubt there entred into the womans harte an evil kinde
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13275:98"/>of diſtruſt, leaſt hapily the picture might have ben marked with thoſe ſignes even from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. But that the former miracle,
<note place="margin">If the Vſe of pictures had not bene law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full God had not wrought ſo many wonders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this picture.</note> might not be contemned, the power of God vouchſafed, to adde thereto, a ſecond. For the ſignes forthwith di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſappearing, the picture was of the priviledges, the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reby deprived: that by the ſigne enſueing, proofe might be made, of that which had gonne before.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Catalonia</hi> alſo at a place called <hi>Ilerda,</hi> it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that a certaine man named <hi>Iohn,</hi> whoe bare greate devotion to bleſſed Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> did travell one evening late, along by a certaine way, where ſome deſperate perſons, did ſecrettely lie in waite, to doe a murder: howbeit not vpon him, with whom they had no enmity, but vpon another that ſeemed to be like vnto him, and was even then alſo with him in company. But one of them iſſueinge ſodeinly out of the place of deceite, &amp; taking him to be the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that was his enemie, did ſoe deathful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie begoare him, with a number of woundes, that there was no hope to be had, for the recoverie of his life. For, at the very firſt ſtroake, he had almoſt cut of his whole ſhoulder and arme together: and with the ſecond blow, which entred in at the breſt ſomewhat vnder the nipple; he made ſuch an open gap, &amp; rifture into the bodie, that the winde com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming out fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, wouldat one time putout ſome ſixe light Candells, being ioyned alltogether. Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therefore by the iudgement of the Phiſitions, that his cure was impoſſible, in regard of the putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his woundes, which yelded forth ſuch an intollerable ſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>che, that even his owne wife, did
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13275:99"/>exceedingly loth it; &amp; perceaving alſo that he could not haue help by any humane remedies, he whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turned himſelfe, with all his beſt devotion to crave the patronadge, of the bleſſed Father Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> whom with the bleſſed Virgin, he had moſt faithfully invocated, in the very middeſt of his ſtroakes. And behold, as he lay miſerably waking in his bed,
<note place="margin">Loe where Saints are inuocated and being innocated doe helpe thoſe which pray vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> all ſolitarie and full of diſtreſſe, and did with mourneful lamentation, oftentimes reiterate the name of <hi>Francis;</hi> there ſtoode one by him in the habite of affriar Minor, having entred, as to him it ſeemed, in at the windowe, whoe calling him by his name, did ſay vnto him; Becauſe that in me thou haſt had hope &amp; confidence be holde our Lord will deliuer thee. And being, by the diſtreſſed creature, demaunded who he was; he made anſweare, that he was <hi>Francis.</hi> Wherevpon drawing nighe forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with vnto him, he preſently vnlooſed the clothes, that bounde vp his woundes: and did, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaved, annoynt all thoſe woundes with a certaine kinde of oyntement. But ſo ſoone as ever he felt the ſweete touche, of thoſe ſacred handes, which by the force and vertue, of the Stigmattes of our Saviour, were able to giue helpe and remedie, the corruption being driven quite away, the flesh fully repaired, and the woundes throughly healed, he was perfectly reſtored vnto his former healthe and ſtrength. Which being donne, the bleſſed Father departed. And he finding himſelf to be healed, and burſting forth, into a gladſome voice, of the praiſe of God, and of bleſſed Saint <hi>Francis;</hi> did preſently call his wife vnto him. Who running ſpeedily, and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13275:99"/>beholding him, now to ſtand vpon his feete, whom shee made accounte shee should haue buried, in the day following; being ſtriken with a great ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and amazement thereat, did ſill, with her cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and outcrie, al the nighbourhood ther about. But his neighbours and frinds comming in ſtraite waies vpon him, and goeing aboute to haue him backe againe to his bed, as one that were frantique and out of his wittes; he vtterly refuſed ſoe to doe, shewing himſelfe to be now healed, &amp; throughly recovered. Wherevpon they were all, ſoe excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly aſtonished, that being as it were without their ſince or vnderſtanding, they held it to be a fantaſticall thing, which they did behold: conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that whom they had but a litle before ſeene, to be with moſt cruell woundes butchered, and worne quite away; him did they now obſerue, to be ful of ioy, vpon the perfect recoverie of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſtrength. And therefore the ſaied vnto them: doe ye in no wiſe feare, neither yet doe ye thinke it to be a vaine thing which you ſee: becauſe Saint <hi>Francis</hi> is but lately departed from the place; who hath by the touche of thoſe his holy handes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured me, of all my woundes.

                  <p>At <hi>Potentia,</hi> a Cittie in <hi>Apulia,</hi> there was a certaine man named <hi>Roger:</hi> a man of honorabſe place, and a Cannon of the great Church. Whoe being one time not well at eaſe, and comming even then into the Church to pray, where the picture of bleſſed Saint <hi>Frantis</hi> was ſette out with his gloriouſe Stig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mattes, did beginne to doubt of the high degree and nature of that miracle, as of a thing altogether vnuſuall and impoſſible. And ſodeinely therefore, while, being inwardly wounded in his minde, he thought with himſelfe ſuch vaine and frivolouſe things; behold, in the palme of his left hand, vnder his gloue, he felt himſelfe to be grievouſly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: hearing the ſounde of a ſtroake, as if it had ben of an arrowe ſhot out of a crosbowe. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſently thervpon no leſſe pained with the wounde, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aſtoniſhed with the ſound, he pulled of his gloue, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: that by ſight of the eye, he might fully know what he had already percea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, both by his feeling, &amp; hearing. And whereas
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13275:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>in the palme of his hand, there had formerly ben, no ſigne of any ſtroake at al, yet now he perceaved therin a wonde, newly made (as it were) with the ſtroak of an arrowe: out of which proceeded, ſo great a violence of burning heate: that he ſeemed ready, almoſt to die, for paine thereof. It is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veilouſe thing to be ſpoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. There appeared not in the gloue, any ſigne thereof at all: that vnto the ſecrette and hidden wounde of his hart, the paine of his bodily wounde, ſecretely receaved, might duly be conformed. From that time forward ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for two daies ſpace together, he cried and roared pittifully, out of the moſt grievouſe vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his torment: and the lurking thought of his incredulous harte, he diſcovered vnto al men.

He finally in humble manner beſought the Saint of God, by thoſe his holy Stigmattes, to help him: and the manifold praiers of his hart, he watered and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched, with a plentifull ſtreame of teares. Now ſee another wonder. The incredulity being thus, vtterly caſt away: after the health of the minde, health alſo of the body, forthwith enſued. For now all paine and griefe was at an ende, the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning heate, was cooled, and of the blow it ſelfe, no marke or ſigne remained.

Wherevpon the people about her, eſteeming her to be perfectly dead; and her head to be bruiſed, altogether; did cover her, with a garment of her owne; that after the ende of the Sermon, shee might be had out of the Church, as a lamentable

He therefore, as ſoone as he was fowerteene yeares olde, became a Frier mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, growing afterwardes to be a learned man, and a famouſe preacher, in the order.</p>
                  <p>The men of <hi>Lentinum,</hi> had hewen an exceeding greate ſtone, out of the mountaine, the which was to be put vnder an alter of a Churche of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> that was shortely to be conſectated.

Where vppon, the men being confuſed in minde, and not knowing what to doe, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter parte of them departed away, without hope of helpe. But tenne of the men, that remained behinde, invocating S. <hi>Francis,</hi> with mourneful voice, and deſiring him not to ſuffer a man, ſoe horriblie to dye in his ſeruice, taking at length good harte vnto them, did with ſo great a facil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, remoue the ſtone, that no man might doubte, but that the power of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> was preſent amongſt them. The man finally roſe vp ſtrong and ſounde, in all his members: and more ouer he obtained; the cleare and perfect ſighte, of his eies, which had bin before, duskish and obcured: that ſo all men might be geuen to vnderſtand, of howe

                  <p>The very like happened at Saint <hi>Severines,</hi> in the Marquiſate of <hi>Ancona.</hi> For, as a greate ſtone being brought from <hi>Conſtantnople,</hi> vnto a Church of S. <hi>Francis,</hi> was drawen along, by the ſtrength of many men, it fell moſt terribly, vpon one of them, that drewe it. And whereas it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally believed, that he was not only dead, but was alſo broken and crushed to pieces: by the helpe of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> who lifted vppe the ſtone, he caſting of the waight thereof, did leape vppe ſafe and ſounde, without any hurte at all.</p>
                  <p>One <hi>Bartholomewe</hi> alſo, a Cittizen of <hi>Caieta,</hi> labouring not a litle, in the building of a certaine Church of Saint <hi>Francis</hi> by meane of a certaine beame that having binne but ſlightly ſet, did fall and light vppon his neck, was therewithal grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly bruiſed.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13275:108"/>who would haue hindred thee in my ſervice, ſhall not prevaile againſt thee.

And ſo drawing his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, along over the woundes; he willed him to returne, vnto the worke he had taken in hand. Who riſing vp therefore, very timely in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and preſenting himſelfe ſounde and well, before them that had left him, even at deathes doore, did bring vppon them, both wonder and amazement. And furthermore, he ſtirred vppe their mindes, vnto the reverence and loue, of the bleſſed Father, as wel by his owne example, as by the miracle of the Saint.</p>
                  <p>A certaine man alſo of the towne of <hi>Cepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> named <hi>Nicholas,</hi> did fall one day into the handes of his mercileſſe enemies: who in the fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceneſſe of their ſavadge cruelty, heaping wounds after woundes, in great ſtore vpon him, did in ſo exceſſiue a degree exerciſe their fury; vpon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable man, that they tooke him either to be dead outright,

And this voice, divers heard a great way of, although they were not able to relieue him. But heing carried home at length, al begoared, in his owne bloode, he couſidentllie
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:13275:109"/>avouched, that he ſhould not ſee death by meane of thoſe woundes: nor yet that he did even then feele, any paine of them: for that Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> had ſuccoured him, and had obtained of God, for him, time to doe pennance in. Which the evente enſuing, confirmed. For being waſhed from the bloud, he was forthwith (beiond al humane hope) clarely delivered.</p>
                  <p>Alſo a certain noble mans ſonne, in the towne of Saint <hi>Geminianus,</hi> being taken with a grievouſe ſickneſſe, and paſt hope, of any better recoverie was finally brought, vnto the very exigent and point of deathe. For a ſtreame of bloud yſſued forth of his eies, as it is commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly ſeene to do, out of a vaine, in the arme. And by other vndoubted tokens alſo, of death approaching, as appeared, in the other partes of his body, he was of al men iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, &amp; reputed for a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As alſo, being in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, of the weakeneſſe of his ſpirit and ſtrength deprived of the vſe of his ſence &amp; motion, he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be already departed. His parents therfore and frinds, being gathered togeather (as the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome is) in way of lamentation: and thinking of noe other thing, but of his buriall, his Father, yet conceaving hope in our Lord ranne ſpeedily vnto the Church of Saint <hi>Francis:</hi> which was built in the ſame towne: and hanging a girdle about his necke, did withall humility, proſtrate himſelfe, vpon the earth, and ſoe, making his vowes, and multiplying his praiers,

And even then, a Prieſt that was preſent, admoniſhing him, to make his confeſſion, was not able, to extorte from him, ſoo much as a worde.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours came about him: they ledde him out of the priſon: they hung him vpon the torture: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed vpon him, many and ſundrie waights of iron.

Beinge therefore, in this veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſtreſſe; and deſperate, of all humane helpe; he beganne, one nighte: as thoughe he had ſeene S. <hi>Frances,</hi> preſent; to take this occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before him: Helpe me (ſaied he) O Sainte <hi>Frances</hi> remembring my ſervice, and the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I haue exhibited, vnto thee. For I haue car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried thee, vppon mine Aſſe: I haue kiſſed thy holy feete, and thy holie handes: I haue alwaies binne devoute, vnto thee: I haue binne evermore, readie to ſerue thee: and behold, now I die, with the moſt greivouſe torment, of this diſeaſe. With theſe his complaintes: he that is never vnmindefull, of the benefitts beſtowed vpon him; but is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually gratefull, for the devotion, which is vſed towards him: beinge moved, and incited, did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſtand before him: and did with one bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, appeare vnto him. He tolde him, that he was comme at his call: and had brought with him, helpes, for his recoverie. With a litle ſtaffe therefore, that had in it the figure, of the letter <hi>Thau,</hi> he toucht the place, where the paine did lie: and therewithall breaking, an impoſtume: he preſently reſtored him to perfect healthe. And whiche is more marveilous: imprinting the ſacred ſigne of <hi>Thau,</hi> vppon the place of the healed vlcer, he left it there, to remaine: in memorie, of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle. With this marke, S. <hi>Frances</hi> vſed to ſigne his
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:13275:128"/>letters: as often as for charities ſake: he directed any. But beholde, now gentle reader meane while that our minde, being diſtracted with varietie, of narrations: hathe paſſed along, thrugh divers miracles, of the gloriouſe father, S. <hi>Frances:</hi> by meritte of that gloriouſe ſtandard bearer, of the Croſſe; it hathe now, not without divine dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: lighted vppon the ſigne <hi>Thau,</hi> which is the ſigne of ſalvation: to the intent, that out of it, wee may obſerue: that like as, the Croſſe, was in his warfare after Chriſte: a highe advauncement of meritte, vnto ſalvation: ſoe is it alſo vnto him, now with Chriſte, triumphing: made a firme matter of teſtimony, to his honor. For this greate and marveilouſe miſterie, of the Croſſe: wherein the peculiar guiftes, of graces; the merittes, of vertues: and the treaſures, of wiſedome and knowledge: are in ſoe profounde a degree, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and concealed: that it is kept ſecrette, from the wiſe and prudent, of this worlde, was yet ſoe plentifully and fully revealed, vnto this litle one of Chriſte: that all his life, dothe follow noe other thing, than the very footeſtepps, of the Croſſe: he dothe ſavour, of noe other thing, than of the ſweeteneſſe of the Croſſe: nor yet dothe preache, or denounce, any other thing, than the glory, of the Croſſe. Well, therefore, and truly, might he ſay, with the Apoſtle: in the beginning of his converſion: <hi>God forbid that I should glorie, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the Croſſe of our lord</hi> IESVS <hi>Chriſte:</hi> And no leſſe truly, mighte he ſay, in the progreſſe, of his converſation: <hi>whoeſoeuer shall followe this rule, peace
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:13275:128"/>vppon them, and mercie.</hi> But moſt truly, mighte he, in the conſummation of his life, thereto adioyne, the wordes enſueing: <hi>I beare the markes of our lorde</hi> IESVS <hi>in my bodie.</hi> And theſe wordes alſo, we dailie deſire, from him to heare: <hi>The grace of our Lord</hi> IESVS <hi>Chriſte be with your ſpiritte brethren. Amen.</hi>

                  <p>Glorie now therefore ſecurely, in the Croſſes glorie; thou gloriouſe ſtandard bearer of Chriſte: for that having taken thy beginning, from the Croſſe; according to the rule, of the Croſſe, thou haſte made, thy proceeding: and finally, making thine ende in the Croſſe; of howe greate glory, thou arte in heaven; it dothe, by the teſtimony of the Croſſe, evidently appeare, to all faithefull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Securely now, may they followe thee; whoe doe departe, out of <hi>Aegipte:</hi> for that, having devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the redde Sea, by the ſtaffe, of the Croſſe of Chriſte, they ſhall paſſe thoroughe the deſerts, into the promiſed land of the living: and having alſo paſſed over; the <hi>Iordane,</hi> of this mortalitie; they shall, by the marveilouſe power, of the Croſſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereinto. Whither, wee beſeerhe him, whoe is the true conductor, and Saviour of his people, <hi>Ieſus Chriſte,</hi> crucified; mercifully to bring vs, by the merittes of his ſervaunte, S. <hi>Francis:</hi> to the praiſe and glorie of God, whoe being three in perſonne, and one in ſubſtance, liveth and raigneth, everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly.
